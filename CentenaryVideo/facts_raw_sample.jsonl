RAJIV SHEKHAR\n(DIRECTOR, IIT ISM DHANBAD)\n\nIIT(ISM) @2026:\n100 YEARS OF LEGACY\nIIT (ISM) Dhanbad is an institution steeped in rich history, has a throbbing presence and\nembodies a promising future. Founded in 1926, Indian School of Mines emerged as a\ndistinct brand by contributing exponentially to the energy sector and related fields of\nengineering, impacting lives in a transformative way – regionally, nationally as well as\nglobally. For obvious reasons, even today, the institute’s reputation for excellence largely\nrests on its relative strengths in Mining, Petroleum, Earth Sciences and allied areas. If\nmaintaining its core is a matter of firm conviction and determination for us, expanding the\nboundaries of knowledge and embracing the best practices in knowledge is the pressing\nneed of the hour. Most of the leading institutions of the world have grown to their current\nstature due to their diversification in newer fields of knowledge and through their strategic\nexpansion. IIT (ISM), too, envisions growing in a similar pattern by promoting a culture of\nbroad inquiry.\nVISION AND MISSION\nAlongside keeping committed to its\nmotto for the urge for the light of new\nknowledge, IIT (ISM) envisages to\nadvance steadily to register its presence\namong the top 200 leading knowledge\nenterprises in the world.\nDREAM TOGETHER - BUILD\nTOGETHER\nTo achieve its Vision and Mission, to\nkindle and to sustain a passion for\nexcellence, to build upon its proud\ntraditions and strengths, to see the\nInstitute achieve stellar heights, it is\nessential for Each & All associated with\nthe institute – the IIT (ISM) Community –\nto step in for a participatory role, to be\nthe innovative change makers and\nshapers of the Institute. Our collective\naction will influence the change we\nenvision!\n\nTHE ALUMNUS-ALMA MATER CONNECT:\nA BOND TO CHERISH FOREVER\n‘Alumnus’ in Latin is ‘foster child’ and such is the unique, deep and enduring bond\nbetween the alumnus and her alma mater which is nurtured through substantial\nmentoring, care, nursing, and life-training. The Alma Mater Connect is a golden chain of\nmemory, a link that binds the alumnus to the place, to that seat of knowledge, generating\na sense of belongingness, a sense of pride; it’s a kinship that cannot be articulated in words.\nFor an academic institution, its students are its brand ambassadors. This kinship has played\na pivotal role in many institutions of the world. For us, too, the important unit of the IIT\n(ISM) Community is our Alumni. The institute has generated a base of alumni who made\nthe country proud in their chosen fields. Today our alumni hold influential positions\nworldwide. It is a massive force to be tapped for the Institute’s overall growth.\nIndeed, as protocol of giving back, our illustrious alumni have generously instituted a\nnumber of awards in the form of scholarships, medals, prizes and incentives for promoting\nexcellence in academics and research. And it is well said that nobody is concerned about\nthe institute more than its alumni.\nREMINISCENCES OF A TIMELESS SPRING: CAMPUS DAYS\nLet’s strike the chord! The treasured remembrances of one’s college days are no less than a\nstorehouse of a timeless spring which is often bewitching and tantalizing. Despite being\neverlastingly busy, you must have had flash of moments that transported you back in time\nand space to conjure up long-gone moments of your campus life. JUST THINK: while\nwalking down the memory lanes, how often you got drenched in the pool of thoughts, of\nthose uncheckable flow of images which re-lit and magnified those little moments of joys\nwhen you walked past the Penman Auditorium or while sipping from your tea cup you\nwould slip into some mental mapping, musing over the piled-up assignments that were to\nbe submitted before its due; amidst all the clatter and chatter at the RD (Ramdhani) Tea-\nStall, playing, laughing, amusing yourself or simply plunging into a pensive state – how\noften you must have re-lived your Timeless Spring."}

RAJIV SHEKHAR\n(DIRECTOR, IIT ISM DHANBAD)\n\nIIT(ISM) @2026:\n100 YEARS OF LEGACY\nIIT (ISM) Dhanbad is an institution steeped in rich history, has a throbbing presence and\nembodies a promising future. Founded in 1926, Indian School of Mines emerged as a\ndistinct brand by contributing exponentially to the energy sector and related fields of\nengineering, impacting lives in a transformative way – regionally, nationally as well as\nglobally. For obvious reasons, even today, the institute’s reputation for excellence largely\nrests on its relative strengths in Mining, Petroleum, Earth Sciences and allied areas. If\nmaintaining its core is a matter of firm conviction and determination for us, expanding the\nboundaries of knowledge and embracing the best practices in knowledge is the pressing\nneed of the hour. Most of the leading institutions of the world have grown to their current\nstature due to their diversification in newer fields of knowledge and through their strategic\nexpansion. IIT (ISM), too, envisions growing in a similar pattern by promoting a culture of\nbroad inquiry.\nVISION AND MISSION\nAlongside keeping committed to its\nmotto for the urge for the light of new\nknowledge, IIT (ISM) envisages to\nadvance steadily to register its presence\namong the top 200 leading knowledge\nenterprises in the world.\nDREAM TOGETHER - BUILD\nTOGETHER\nTo achieve its Vision and Mission, to\nkindle and to sustain a passion for\nexcellence, to build upon its proud\ntraditions and strengths, to see the\nInstitute achieve stellar heights, it is\nessential for Each & All associated with\nthe institute – the IIT (ISM) Community –\nto step in for a participatory role, to be\nthe innovative change makers and\nshapers of the Institute. Our collective\naction will influence the change we\nenvision!\n\nTHE ALUMNUS-ALMA MATER CONNECT:\nA BOND TO CHERISH FOREVER\n‘Alumnus’ in Latin is ‘foster child’ and such is the unique, deep and enduring bond\nbetween the alumnus and her alma mater which is nurtured through substantial\nmentoring, care, nursing, and life-training. The Alma Mater Connect is a golden chain of\nmemory, a link that binds the alumnus to the place, to that seat of knowledge, generating\na sense of belongingness, a sense of pride; it’s a kinship that cannot be articulated in words.\nFor an academic institution, its students are its brand ambassadors. This kinship has played\na pivotal role in many institutions of the world. For us, too, the important unit of the IIT\n(ISM) Community is our Alumni. The institute has generated a base of alumni who made\nthe country proud in their chosen fields. Today our alumni hold influential positions\nworldwide. It is a massive force to be tapped for the Institute’s overall growth.\nIndeed, as protocol of giving back, our illustrious alumni have generously instituted a\nnumber of awards in the form of scholarships, medals, prizes and incentives for promoting\nexcellence in academics and research. And it is well said that nobody is concerned about\nthe institute more than its alumni.\nREMINISCENCES OF A TIMELESS SPRING: CAMPUS DAYS\nLet’s strike the chord! The treasured remembrances of one’s college days are no less than a\nstorehouse of a timeless spring which is often bewitching and tantalizing. Despite being\neverlastingly busy, you must have had flash of moments that transported you back in time\nand space to conjure up long-gone moments of your campus life. JUST THINK: while\nwalking down the memory lanes, how often you got drenched in the pool of thoughts, of\nthose uncheckable flow of images which re-lit and magnified those little moments of joys\nwhen you walked past the Penman Auditorium or while sipping from your tea cup you\nwould slip into some mental mapping, musing over the piled-up assignments that were to\nbe submitted before its due; amidst all the clatter and chatter at the RD (Ramdhani) Tea-\nStall, playing, laughing, amusing yourself or simply plunging into a pensive state – how\noften you must have re-lived your Timeless Spring."}

RAJIV SHEKHAR\n(DIRECTOR, IIT ISM DHANBAD)\n\nIIT(ISM) @2026:\n100 YEARS OF LEGACY\nIIT (ISM) Dhanbad is an institution steeped in rich history, has a throbbing presence and\nembodies a promising future. Founded in 1926, Indian School of Mines emerged as a\ndistinct brand by contributing exponentially to the energy sector and related fields of\nengineering, impacting lives in a transformative way – regionally, nationally as well as\nglobally. For obvious reasons, even today, the institute’s reputation for excellence largely\nrests on its relative strengths in Mining, Petroleum, Earth Sciences and allied areas. If\nmaintaining its core is a matter of firm conviction and determination for us, expanding the\nboundaries of knowledge and embracing the best practices in knowledge is the pressing\nneed of the hour. Most of the leading institutions of the world have grown to their current\nstature due to their diversification in newer fields of knowledge and through their strategic\nexpansion. IIT (ISM), too, envisions growing in a similar pattern by promoting a culture of\nbroad inquiry.\nVISION AND MISSION\nAlongside keeping committed to its\nmotto for the urge for the light of new\nknowledge, IIT (ISM) envisages to\nadvance steadily to register its presence\namong the top 200 leading knowledge\nenterprises in the world.\nDREAM TOGETHER - BUILD\nTOGETHER\nTo achieve its Vision and Mission, to\nkindle and to sustain a passion for\nexcellence, to build upon its proud\ntraditions and strengths, to see the\nInstitute achieve stellar heights, it is\nessential for Each & All associated with\nthe institute – the IIT (ISM) Community –\nto step in for a participatory role, to be\nthe innovative change makers and\nshapers of the Institute. Our collective\naction will influence the change we\nenvision!\n\nTHE ALUMNUS-ALMA MATER CONNECT:\nA BOND TO CHERISH FOREVER\n‘Alumnus’ in Latin is ‘foster child’ and such is the unique, deep and enduring bond\nbetween the alumnus and her alma mater which is nurtured through substantial\nmentoring, care, nursing, and life-training. The Alma Mater Connect is a golden chain of\nmemory, a link that binds the alumnus to the place, to that seat of knowledge, generating\na sense of belongingness, a sense of pride; it’s a kinship that cannot be articulated in words.\nFor an academic institution, its students are its brand ambassadors. This kinship has played\na pivotal role in many institutions of the world. For us, too, the important unit of the IIT\n(ISM) Community is our Alumni. The institute has generated a base of alumni who made\nthe country proud in their chosen fields. Today our alumni hold influential positions\nworldwide. It is a massive force to be tapped for the Institute’s overall growth.\nIndeed, as protocol of giving back, our illustrious alumni have generously instituted a\nnumber of awards in the form of scholarships, medals, prizes and incentives for promoting\nexcellence in academics and research. And it is well said that nobody is concerned about\nthe institute more than its alumni.\nREMINISCENCES OF A TIMELESS SPRING: CAMPUS DAYS\nLet’s strike the chord! The treasured remembrances of one’s college days are no less than a\nstorehouse of a timeless spring which is often bewitching and tantalizing. Despite being\neverlastingly busy, you must have had flash of moments that transported you back in time\nand space to conjure up long-gone moments of your campus life. JUST THINK: while\nwalking down the memory lanes, how often you got drenched in the pool of thoughts, of\nthose uncheckable flow of images which re-lit and magnified those little moments of joys\nwhen you walked past the Penman Auditorium or while sipping from your tea cup you\nwould slip into some mental mapping, musing over the piled-up assignments that were to\nbe submitted before its due; amidst all the clatter and chatter at the RD (Ramdhani) Tea-\nStall, playing, laughing, amusing yourself or simply plunging into a pensive state – how\noften you must have re-lived your Timeless Spring."}
