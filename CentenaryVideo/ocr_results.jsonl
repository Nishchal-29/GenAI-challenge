In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent.

Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG.

In 1967 it was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under\nSection 3 of UGC Act, 1956. Over the last eight decades, ISM has incorporated important\ncore engineering disciplines and has acquired the status of full-fledged institute of global\nstanding in imparting higher education in engineering, science and management.\n\nThe present report contains the research, academic and related activities of the Institute for\nthe period 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015. During this period, therewere substantia)\ndevelopments in all fronts such as student strength, number of research scholars,\ninfrastructure development, research publications, external cash flow from projects sponsored\nby industries and national funding agencies. The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

Over the last eight decades, ISM has incorporated important\ncore engineering disciplines and has acquired the status of full-fledged institute of global\nstanding in imparting higher education in engineering, science and management.\n\nThe present report contains the research, academic and related activities of the Institute for\nthe period 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015. During this period, therewere substantia)\ndevelopments in all fronts such as student strength, number of research scholars,\ninfrastructure development, research publications, external cash flow from projects sponsored\nby industries and national funding agencies. The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth.

In 1967 it was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under\nSection 3 of UGC Act, 1956. Over the last eight decades, ISM has incorporated important\ncore engineering disciplines and has acquired the status of full-fledged institute of global\nstanding in imparting higher education in engineering, science and management.\n\nThe present report contains the research, academic and related activities of the Institute for\nthe period 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015. During this period, therewere substantia)\ndevelopments in all fronts such as student strength, number of research scholars,\ninfrastructure development, research publications, external cash flow from projects sponsored\nby industries and national funding agencies. The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features.

In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent.

Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth.

In 1967 it was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under\nSection 3 of UGC Act, 1956. Over the last eight decades, ISM has incorporated important\ncore engineering disciplines and has acquired the status of full-fledged institute of global\nstanding in imparting higher education in engineering, science and management.\n\nThe present report contains the research, academic and related activities of the Institute for\nthe period 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015. During this period, therewere substantia)\ndevelopments in all fronts such as student strength, number of research scholars,\ninfrastructure development, research publications, external cash flow from projects sponsored\nby industries and national funding agencies. The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967 it was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under\nSection 3 of UGC Act, 1956. Over the last eight decades, ISM has incorporated important\ncore engineering disciplines and has acquired the status of full-fledged institute of global\nstanding in imparting higher education in engineering, science and management.\n\nThe present report contains the research, academic and related activities of the Institute for\nthe period 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015. During this period, therewere substantia)\ndevelopments in all fronts such as student strength, number of research scholars,\ninfrastructure development, research publications, external cash flow from projects sponsored\nby industries and national funding agencies. The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features.

In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say.

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent.

Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth.

The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D. C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C. Panigrahi)\nDirector"}

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967 it was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under\nSection 3 of UGC Act, 1956. Over the last eight decades, ISM has incorporated important\ncore engineering disciplines and has acquired the status of full-fledged institute of global\nstanding in imparting higher education in engineering, science and management.\n\nThe present report contains the research, academic and related activities of the Institute for\nthe period 1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015. During this period, therewere substantia)\ndevelopments in all fronts such as student strength, number of research scholars,\ninfrastructure development, research publications, external cash flow from projects sponsored\nby industries and national funding agencies. The campus placement continued to remain high\nwith increase in the highest and the average pay packages. Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

This\nschool will, we trust, be the training ground of many of those who are destined\nto take an active part in the development of the immense resources of this\ncountry. We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features. Those\ncountries look back upon a century of struggle, upon a period when\nmaterial progress had outstripped social ideals. The long history leading up to"}

It one\nlong struggle of re-adjustment of an Endeavour on the part of social ideals to\nkeep pace with mechanical efficiency. In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say. I regard the school as a great means for\ntraining on right lines the mental outlook towards social questions of the\nindustrialists of the future, and its foundation in the first year of my office I look\nupon as of hopeful augury."}

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India. Although the silver jubilee souvenler volume of\nISMAG aims, I understand, at it being largely technical, I am to be forgiven if\nincline towards the popular or Reminiscent. As former Principal, responsible in\na large degree for ensuring the extensive developments that have taken place\nsince I left India I like look back on the earlier days still vivid in my memory.\n\narrived about midnight on the Dhanbad Station platform on 1° November,\n\n1926, standing on the platform was a figure not then very familiar to me-\nthat of Dr. Penman, the first principal I had met him while I was on the staff of\nthe Heriot-Watt College Edinburgh; I could not then guess that we should\nultimately become closely associated in work in India. Our association was\nfrom that first a happy one and, I think, a successful one.\n\nleft in 1948 what was then a somewhat pleasantly laid-out estate, marred, it\n\nis true, by the remains of military occupation, and, of course, in the throat\nof further building. It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

I\ndo not think it would be an overstatement to say that much of foundatics of fuel\nresearch in India was laid at Indian School of Mines. In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth. The importance of India’s coal mining industry and its relation to\npractically all other industry made it inevitable that the Indian School of Mines"}

In 1967\nit was granted the status of a Deemed to be University under Section 3 of UGC Act, 1956. ISM has\nevolved over the last eight decades and is poised to emerge as a full-fledged higher technical\neducation institute of national and international repute.\n\nThe present report contains the academic and related activities of the Institute for the period 1st\nApril 2013 to 31st March 2014. This year was marked by very good progress by way of increase in\nstudent strength, number of research scholars, infrastructure development and external cash flow\nfrom industry and other funding agencies. The student strength increased from 4916 in 2012-13 to\n5805 in 2013-14. The number of academic programmes also has gone up from 45 to 52 in the last\nyear. In the last five years the student strength in the campus increased from 2965 to 5805. In the\nsame period the research scholar strength increased from 162 to 966 and number of faculty\nmembers increased from 105 to 250. The campus placement continued to remain high with increase\nin the highest and the average pay packages.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of International relations with signing of MOUs with\ndifferent universities across the globe. During this academic year 46 students from Afghanistan\njoined ISM. 20 students and 3 faculty members from ISM moved to different universities in Europe\nunder international collaboration programmes spanning from one month to one year duration.\nThis has added an international flavor in the Institute. The Institute was involved in several\nexecutive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas organizations in\naddition to its role to cater to the need of Industries and organizations in the country.\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the changing\ntimes. Efforts were made to procure state-of-the-art experimental facilities worth Rs.33.54 crores,\npaving way for advanced research. The year registered a 86.02% increase in cash flow from R&D\nand industry sponsored projects, and 48.8% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded\ncompared to the previous year. These developments were the outcome of a number of innovative\nsteps taken during the year and in the recent past.\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty members\nand all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these achievements during\nthe last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way for institute's journey\ntowards emergence as anationally and globally acclaimed premier institution of higher education.\n\n(D.C.

It is an attempt to provide in\nthe first place a school of Geology which will rank with similar institutions in\nGreat Britain: it is to furnish a supply of trained men for the coal mining\nindustry and for other mineral industries throughout India: it is to help to solve\nthe problem of recruitment of young men of this country for the Geological\nSurvey of India and Indian Mines Department. The conception is framed on\ngenerous times and cannot fail to appeal to the imagination. The inauguration of\nthe school has, through circumstances beyond our control, been delayed for six\nyears since the final adoption of the proposals by Government. This\npostponement, regrettable as it is, has at least given me the opportunity of being\npresent at this opening ceremony-an opportunity of which I have availed myself\nwith great pleasure.\n\nhere are few branches of knowledge which can compete with geology in\n\nproviding a scientific training of the mind, the habit of close observation\nand correct inference, and in opening up at the same time the way to practical\ncareers of utility, bringing within man’s grasp and making subject to his control\nthe immense resources of nature. To the geologist again, as to few others, is\nunveiled the immense panorama of history from far distance times. He thinks in\nages, as we think in days and years. He finds sermons in stones, romance in\ngranite blocks. In a fault in the hill-side he traces those unimaginable stresses\nand convulsions which have left the earth the shape we know it to-day. From all\nthese points of view, scientific study, practical training, and imaginative\ninterest, geology has few rivals. In India we have already no mean record. The\nGeological Survey of India has for many years been renowned for its high\nstandard of achievement. Even before the days of Sir Thomas Holland and the\nlate Sir Henry Hayden, it had secured world-wide recognition. Under their\nguidance it established itself even more firmly, and its reputation under\nDr.Pascoe stands as high to-day. Not the least of the benefits which we hope for\nfrom this school is the continuance of that tradition and the increasing\nassociation of the picked youth of this country in the work of this fine service."}

We hope that the students whom the school will turn out into the world\nof affairs will leave it not only with a grasp of scientific method but with a\npractical knowledge of the work which they will be called upon to do such as no\nother institution in India has hitherto been able to provide. It is with great\npleasure that I have noticed the large number of applicants for admission to the\nschool. I understand that in the past there has been some reluctance on the part\nof Indian boys to embark on technical studies, and it is a hopeful sign that the\nopening of School has elicited such a favorable response.\n\nn glancing through the prospectus and curriculum of the new school I have\n\nbeen struck by the great variety of subjects with which the students will\nhave to make acquaintances. I have noted with special interest that training in\nthe field, and frequent visits to colleges are included. To this I have no doubt\nyou are right to attach importance, not merely because of the direct experience\nwhich will be gained there from, but because the students will have an\nopportunity to see for themselves the conditions of labor in mines, and to study\nsome of the social problems which are of such vital importance to industry. If\nthey can acquire a real intimacy with and a sympathetic understanding of such\nproblems, the value of their future work for India will be doubled. I look with\nmuch hope to the School to develop in its students vigorous ideals of social\nservice.\n\noming as I do fresh to this country, a country old in history and tradition,\n\nbut in some respects, especially in industrial development, a new country\non the threshold of a great future, there is one thought which is very present in\nmy mind. It is that for us in India industrial development brings a great\nopportunity. India is learning much from Western experiences. She is\ndeveloping industrially-as here inevitably the most develop-very much on\nWestern lines. But with industrial benefits which industrialism brings home also\ndisadvantages and grave dangers. In Western countries the growth of\nindustrialism has a history with many unpleasant and unkindly features.

In that struggle for over a century social\namelioration was ever behind hand in the race. In recent years however, and\nespecially since the war, a great advance has been made. Those who have\nstudied, for instance the record of the international Labor organization at\nGeneva, will realize the efforts that have been made in the last few years to\npromote schemes for raising the moral and material condition of the manual\nworkers in industry, and to place the social standards of development in their\ndue position side by side with mechanical efficiency.\n\nn India we come to this question with the experience of Western countries\n\nbehind us; there is no need for us to work through the painful stages of the\nindustrial revolution and the years that followed that followed it in England.\nThis is what I mean by our opportunity. It is the opportunity to use the\nexperience of others, and to start where they are now. But with this opportunity\ncomes also responsibility. It is for us, for the young men whom this school will\nturn out for the great employers of the labor, who are represented on your\nGoverning Body, and their fellows, to see that this opportunity it seized and this\nresponsibility realized. Every country has, of course, its special circumstances\nto consider. In India progress will not automatically or immediately follow\nprecedent elsewhere. But India cannot remain permanently behind in the matter\nof social legislation and improvement of industrial conditions. What the\nexperience of the world approves elsewhere must sooner or later, making due\nallowance for difference of conditions, find a place in our industrial code. In\nsuch matters, for instance, as the terms of employment of women and children,\nthe hours and conditions of labor in mines and factories: the improvement of\nsanitation and housing of industrial workers: in all these matters and others, our\nopportunity is that we have the experience of the older industrial world to help\nus, and our responsibility that are, the later starters in the industrial race, should\nnot neglect or ignore what that experience can teach us.\n\n¥S tis on this note, the note of opportunity and of responsibility that I desire\nto close what I have had to say.

My feelings of pleasure\nat realizing that this important goal has been reached are tempered by my deep-\nfelt regret at not being able to be present in India beside my former colleagues\nand students and to take part in, what I am sure will be, a successful event of\nnational importance to India.

It may be difficult to imagine the desert-like appearance of\nthe fields that faced me when I arrived. Hardly a tree was visible. Two or three\nMowhua trees were there, one or two Gul-Mohur and, of course, the scrubby\nmass of stunted Palas. The college front was straight and bare. My personal\ninterest in gardening was partly responsible (in collaborates, of course, with the\nC.P.W.D) for the few hundred trees that now grace the estate. The two\nJacarandas that show their delicate blue flowers once a year on either side of\nthe college were brought by me as seeds from topchanchi, many years ago. The\ncoal sampling laboratory now covers the site of one magnificent Amaltas that\nshaded the Chemistry Department for many hot sessions."}

In saying this I must\nrecord in particular the names of my friends, Mr. B.B Niyogi and\nMr.J.N.Mazundar. With meager funds and little apparatus we could not cover as\nmuch as we should have liked, but I think the results served a useful purpose.\n\nwenty-one years comprise a large slice out of a man’s life and it brings\n\nmany memories of persons and of events. Of the many earlier figures on\nthe scene I single out a very humble colleague. Mir Niaz All, our dak peon\nwho faithfully trudged up and down the D.B Road, Puggarea and Kulla perched\nat an odd angle, puttees seldom very presentable, but the legs as steady and\nfaithful as their respected owner. His was the first Indian School of Mines face\nthat I saw in India. He met me at the gangway of the “City of Nagpur” on my\narrival at the-Dock at Calcutta. A host of other names comes to my mind among\nthem an equally humble servant Baneswar Mala who lost an eye in our service\nand finally died in harness. I still remember the contractor who made the earlier\nfurniture that many of us have cursed in past years: he shall be nameless.\n\nmong the more distinguished names are, of course, those of our visitors\n\nincluding the Victory, Lord Irwin, who opened the college formally on\n9.12.26. The visit of Indian Statutory Commission in December, 1928 and of\nthe Royal (Whisley} Commission on Labor in January, 1930 brought shoals of\nimpeccant visitors. Every successive Governor of the province and many\nministers as well as members of the Viceroy’s Council and finally Lord Wavett\nis on the list, but space does not permit of enumerating them.\n\nx should have liked to refer to those members of our lecturing staff, who\nwere with us in earlier years, but space again does not make that possible\nand I may perhaps be allowed to offer a further contribution for a later issue to\nISMAG. This opportunity is very appropriate for a message for the future.\n\neen against the background of the past visualize the Indian School of\nMines marching forward under proper guidance to a position of greater\nand greater importance in the realm of the development of India’s mineral\nwealth.

Further, the Institute was involved\nin several executive training programmes and industry sponsored project work for overseas\norganizations in addition to its role to cater to the need of industries and organizations in the\ncountry.\n\nThis year marked a new beginning in the area of international relations with signing of\nMOUs with different universities across the globe. During this academic year, 51\ninternational students joined ISM. 20 students and 79 faculty members from ISM moved to\ndifferent foreign universities under international collaboration programmes spanning from\none month to one year duration including participation in International Conferences. During\nthis period the institute was entrusted to mentor in establishing Afghan School of Mines at\nKabul as assigned by Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India to augment bilateral\niplomacy between Government of India and Islamic Republic of Afghanishtan.\n\na\n\nThe Institute is making foray into the newer areas of academic endeavors in tune with the\nanging times. The year registered 20% increase in cash flow from sponsored projects, and.\n4% increase in the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded compared to the previous year. These\nlevelopments were the outcome of a number of innovative steps taken during the year and in\n© recent past.\n\nfawa\n\nI would like to express my deep appreciation and special thanks to the students, faculty\nmembers and all the employees of ISM for their commitment in bringing about these\nachievements during the last year. Their dedication and hard work would always pave way\nfor institute’s journey towards emergence as a nationally and globally acclaimed premier\ninstitution of higher education.\n\nrole’\n\nop\n\n(D.
