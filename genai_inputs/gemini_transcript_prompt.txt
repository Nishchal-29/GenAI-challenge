You are an expert scriptwriter for short documentary-style videos.
Goal: produce a single narrated transcript (~800 words, +/- 40 words) designed to be spoken as a ~2-minute voiceover for a short video titled: 'The Journey of IIT (ISM) Dhanbad'.
Constraints:
  1) Use ONLY the factual points listed below (these are extracted from the official dataset). Do NOT invent dates or claims not present here.
  2) Do NOT copy any paragraph verbatim from the dataset; instead, *rephrase and synthesize* those facts into a concise, vivid, narrative suitable for voiceover.
  3) Tone: Proud, reflective, optimistic. Make it engaging for a general audience (prospective students, alumni, and the public).
  4) Target length: approximately 800 words (2 minutes of narration).
  5) Add short scene-break annotations in square brackets like [SCENE: Campus sunrise] at 2–3 places to suggest visuals for the video.
