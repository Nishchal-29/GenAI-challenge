      "Students of the Indian Institute of Technology-Indian School of Mines (IIT ISM), Dhanabad will wear Indian attires and not the traditional gown that they had been wearing for 92 years, during their convocation on Monday.",
      "Besides this, they will also have the choice of taking the convocation pledge in Sanskrit at the first convocation after ISM attained the status of an IIT in 2016.",
      "\"The institution has set new dress code for students for the convocation. Boys will wear pale white or pale cream kurta payjama. Girls will wear off-white sari with matching clothes or off-white or pale cream salwar and kameez,\" Dean of Infrastructure JK Patnayak said.",
      "",
      "Besides this, all students will carry a stole, Patnayak told reporters on the eve of the convocation.",
      "",
      "To a question on why these changes are being introduced, he said earlier students used to wear \"colonial\" gown during convocations. \"It has been changed to promote Indian traditional dresses,\" he said.",
      "\"Students will take pledge either in Sanskrit or in English at the convocation. Sanskrit has been adopted as it is a symbol of Indian culture,\" Patnayak said.",
      "",
      "However, Sanskrit is not mandatory and a student can take pledge in English if he or she so prefers, he said.",
      "IIT-ISM started its journey in 1926 and got the IIT status in 2016. Till date, students used to wear gowns in convocations and take pledge only in English.",
      "The dean of infrastructure said 3,835 students of 2015-16 and 2016-17 sessions will be given degree during the convocation.",
      "\"Altogether, 1,500 students have got registered to take the degree personally,\" Patnayak said, adding that IIT ISM director Rajiv Shekhar will present the degrees.",
      "\"Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to be the chief guest of the convocation on May 25. But his programme was canceled at the last hour due to some unavoidable circumstances,\" Patnayak said.",
      "Thereafter the authorities rescheduled the programme and it would now be a two-day affair beginning Monday.",

      "Students express their happiness after receiving their degree during the 98th Foundation Day celebration of IIT (ISM), in Dhanbad, on Dec. 10, 2023.  \n                                          | Photo Credit: PTI",
      "Studying in an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is usually considered aspirational for students studying in colleges of Tier-2 or Tier-3 towns. Five IITs — Ropar, Guwahati, Mandi, Patna and Kanpur — are now set to change this notion.",
      "For the academic year 2024-25, students studying in Tier-2 or Tier-3 town colleges can also get an IIT tag by opting for a minor specialisation, a diploma, a bachelor’s or a master’s degree, which will be offered in partnership with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and the aforementioned IITs, NSDC CEO Ved Mani Tiwari told The Hindu .",
      "“IITs have opened their doors to those who want to pursue a short-term skilling programme through Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas schemes or an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) student who will like to pursue a certificate or diploma programme from IITs. All the skilling programs will be facilitated via Skill India Digital platform,” Mr. Tiwari said.",
      "The courses will work on credit-based system, where a minor specialisation from IIT will entail taking 10 to 18 credits. “While the core degree will be awarded by the instituting university to which the college is affiliated, there will be a mention of minor specialisation from IIT,” he further said.",
      "In a four-year undergraduate degree, a total of 160 credits would be required to receive a Bachelor of Science degree from an IIT. “Out of total 160 credits, it is proposed to deliver skill component of 18 credits through Skill India Digital (SID) via a strategic delivery partner,” Mr. Tiwari added.",
      "Also, for garnering an executive MTech, the student will have to complete 62 credits, out of which 12 credits of skill component are proposed to be delivered on the SID portal of NSDC through its strategic delivery partner.",
      "For instance, in the tripartite partnership between IIT-Patna, NSDC and Teamlease, they have collaborated for a three-year degree programme — Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA). It is a 155-credit programme of which 146 academic credits shall be provided by IIT-Patna, and nine credits (3 credits per year) shall be covered through the skill-based programmes offered in collaboration between NSDC and Teamlease.",
      "As per provisions of the National Education Policy (NEP), all programmes have been designed with provision of multiple entry and exit options. “Any student enrolled under four-year online UG programme will have the option to exit with a Foundational Certificate after first year, Diploma in the second year, Bachelor’s Degree in third year and Honours degree in fourth year,” Mr. Tiwari said.",
      "For the two-year executive MTech, he said that students who enrol in a 12-month PG Diploma programme can further extend the course to obtain the master’s degree from the IIT after completion of the PG Diploma.",
      "In addition, candidates will have an option to take up the 12-month PG Diploma and opt out without going for the MTech course. The students choosing to opt out after the first semester of PG Diploma will have an option to exit with a PG certification.",
      "“Since these courses are to be offered in online mode, there is no capping on the admission intake but the admission has to take place through an online entrance examination,” Mr. Tiwari said.",

      "The finance minister said that the government plans to increase engineering seats at IITs that began operations after 2014, as well as boost IIT Patna's dormitories and infrastructure capabilities.",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Saturday that the government will increase the number of seats at Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and medical seats by 6,500 and 10,000, respectively, to accommodate more students next year. \"Total number of students in IITs in 2023 has increased by 100% from 65,000 to 1.35 lakh in the past 10 years. Additional infrastructure will be created in the five IITs started after 2014 to facilitate education for 6,500 more students,” she said.",
      "The government's plan in the Union Budget to add 10,000 more seats in medical colleges next year has been hailed by education experts and stakeholders, reported PTI.  The 2025-26 budget witnessed major announcements for the education sector, including infrastructure expansion at five new IITs to accommodate 6,500 more students, 10,000 new medical seats, and a Rs 500 crore allocation to establish a Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence for Education.",

      "The Indian Institutes of Technology are quietly verifying identities of first year students across the 16 premier engineering schools after two candidates secured seats without clearing the admission test, using digitally doctored admit cards of successful aspirants.",
      "",
      "",
      "Both fake candidates were nabbed and have accepted their attempted fraud. But the IITs fear other unqualified students may have sneaked into their coveted undergraduate programmes using manipulated admit cards, Professor GB Reddy, organising chairman of the 2012 IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) confirmed to HT .",
      "",
      "\"Because of the number of students involved, you can’t be completely sure that others haven’t slipped in using this technique,\" Reddy said. \"We don’t want to leave anything to chance.\"",
      "",
      "About 10,000 students were admitted to the IITs and the Indian School of Mines (ISM) Dhanbad based on their scores in the JEE 2012.",
      "",
      "This is the first time the IITs have detected this kind of admissions fraud -- after students have secured seats through the online counseling the institutes conduct after the JEE results are announced -- and the impersonation carries shades of the plot of 2009 blockbuster 3 Idiots.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Previous fraud cases have involved impersonation in the JEE and were detected at that stage. But the 2012 cases point to a novel strategy to perpetrate fraud, which IIT officials believe includes candidates who clear the JEE and then possibly sell their admit cards – the primary document used by the institutes to verify the identity of candidates.",
      "",
      "The Institutes have kept their discovery of the fraud and their follow up action – including an FIR filed against one of the fraud students -- a closely guarded secret, even from the human resource development (HRD) ministry.",
      "",
      "The Joint Admission Board (JAB) of the IITs – the highest admissions-related body of the institutes – has decided that a JEE 2012 team will randomly scrutinize first year students when they appear for their first semester internal examinations, Reddy said.",
      "",
      "These examinations – and the identity check -- have started at different IITs. Students appearing for the internal tests are being checked against photos in admit cards issued by the IITs for the JEE. But students aren’t being told the reasons.",
      "",
      "The IITs caught the fraud students -- a boy who claimed admission to IIT Bhubaneswar and a girl who even joined ISM Dhanbad – when they physically came to their campuses after selecting seats through the online counseling.",
      "",
      "\"There was a mismatch between their digital thumb imprints and those of the candidates who cleared the JEE,\" Reddy said.",
      "",
      "Thumb imprints are recorded when candidates appear for the JEE. Though admission officials are expected to match these imprints with the imprints of students when they actually come to claim their seats after clearing the entrance test, IIT administrators admit that they aren’t convinced about the rigour followed in this process.",
      "",
      "\"The truth is that we only really rely on thumb imprints if we suspect anything wrong after looking at admit cards,\" an IIT Director said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "",
      "Both the fraud candidates caught by the IITs had scanned the admit cards of other, successful, JEE takers, and digitally altered photos on them.",
      "",
      "\"We believe that they hoped to then formally apply for a legal ‘name change,’ switching to their actual names, to complete the fraud,\" an IIT Madras administrator aware of the case said.",
      "",
      "The IIT Bhubaneswar boy ran away from the campus with his bags after he was confronted about the fingerprint mismatch.",
      "His suspicious behaviour prompted a full-fledged investigation by the IITs, in which they confirmed that the photo on the admit card he produced for admissions did not match the one the Institutes had on the admit card they issued.",
      "But the ISM Dhanbad girl challenged the IITs when they questioned her identity, and only accepted her fraud after the institutes filed an FIR against her and the police began their investigation.",
      "The girl withdrew her admission from ISM Dhanbad as a part of a deal agreed to by the IITs in exchange for the institutes withdrawing the FIR.",
      "The IITs have frequently over the past years caught candidates impersonating others in the JEE, including even the son of former IIT Kharagpur Director Shishir Dube.",
      "Instances of more routine cheating during the entrance test are also common but the candidates are usually caught and barred from the test, making those extremely risky routes to adopt in defrauding the IIT admissions system.",
      "But the strategy employed by the fraud students this year points to new tactics that officials described as “more worrying” than what they usually see, because it involves students – and not just the exam taker – adopting a fake identity for four years.",
      "The attempts by the fraud students resemble the role played by Bollywood star Aamir Khan in 3 Idiots.",
      "Khan’s character, a brilliant but poor boy, impersonates the academically weak son of a rich businessman at an engineering college modeled on the IITs for a win-win deal – Khan gets to study, and the rich boy gets a prestigious degree.",
      "About 4.5 lakh students appear for the IIT-JEE each year, competing for 10,000 seats at the 16 IITs and ISM Dhanbad. The chance at success in the IIT entrance examination – one in every 45 applicants – is lower than that at Ivy League universities and even the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), on which the IITs are modelled.",
      "The IITs are viewed as gateways to successful careers across India.",
      "But student aspirations – often bordering on desperation – coupled with the intense competition for seats, have also created fertile ground for newer and newer kinds of admissions fraud.",

      "In a display that could have turned fatal, a group of students from IIT Dhanbad celebrated Diwali this year with a quirky firecracker stunt. The video, showcasing the students lighting a firecracker and covering it with a plastic drum before sprinting away, has amassed over 6 million likes and more than 112 million views across social media platforms.",
      "The annual festival of lights, intended for creating cherished memories with family and friends, took a risky turn as the students engaged in this hazardous experiment. The explosive moment culminated in a thunderous \"boom,\" sending the drum soaring nearly as high as the four-story boys' hostel. While the crowd erupted in laughter and applause, the incident raised serious concerns about safety and the influence of such antics on impressionable peers.",
      "As the video made waves online, the Instagram account @cis_tales captioned it, \"Rocket boys from Aye Aye Tee Dhanbad,\" eliciting a flood of reactions. One user humorously quipped, \"I just hope they don't take this to NASA!\" while another commented, \"Only IITians would think of Diwali as an opportunity for a science experiment.\"",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "\"Elon Musk has booked a flight to recruit these boys for SpaceX,\" a third user said.",
      "\"Next time, try to get over the escape velocity of Earth to reach Mars,\" a fourth remarked.",
      "The enthusiasm from viewers starkly contrasts with the potential dangers of such reckless behaviour.",
      "Commenting on the incident, a user said, \"After lighting the fire, stand inside it, Shaktimaan.\" Another asked, \"Why are these guys not afraid of dying?\"",
      "The event highlights a bittersweet reality: while festivals are moments of joy, they can also serve as reminders of the responsibility that comes with celebration.",

      "Atul Kumar was all smiles as he walked out of the Supreme Court this afternoon. A short while back, a bench led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud used its extraordinary powers to ask IIT Dhanbad to admit Atul Kumar to its electrical engineering course.",
      "The 18-year-old Dalit youth from Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar cracked the difficult entrance exam to the country's most coveted engineering course this year. He is from a family below poverty line and his father, a daily-wage labourer, could not arrange the Rs 17,500 admission fee in time to block the seat.",
      "Atul then ran from pillar to post to save the hard-earned seat. He approached the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, but the panel said it cannot help. Atul also went to the Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority because he had taken the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) at a centre in Jharkhand. The legal services body suggested he approach the Madras High Court because IIT Madras had conducted JEE this time. The high court then asked him to approach the Supreme Court where he got relief.",
      "\"I have been provided with the seat. I am very happy. The court said my seat could not be snatched away solely due to a financial problem. The train that had derailed is back on track now,\" he said with a smile. Atul said he was hopeful of getting help from the top court. Asked what lies ahead, he replied, \"I will work hard and become an electrical engineer from IIT-Dhanbad.\"",
      "Earlier, the Chief Justice-led bench said it cannot allow such a talent to be wasted. \"He went to Jharkhand Legal Services Authority. Then he is (sent) to Chennai legal services and then to the high court. He is a Dalit boy, he is being made to run from pillar to post,\" the bench said.",
      "",
      "",
      "The petitioner's counsel said Atul's father earns Rs 450 daily. \"The task of arranging 17,500 is a big deal. He collected money from villagers.\"",
      "\"The only thing that stopped him from paying was the inability to pay and as the Supreme Court of India, we need to see that,\" the Chief Justice said.",
      "The court used its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to ask IIT Dhanbad to grant admission to Atul in the same batch. \"No existing student be disturbed and let a supernumerary seat be created for the candidate,\" the bench said. The Chief Justice wished Atul: \"All the best. achha kariye!\"",

      "Students of the IIT Indian School of Mines (ISM) in Dhanbad would wear Indian attire and not the traditional gown that they had been wearing for 92 years, during its convocation on Monday.",
      "They would also have the choice of taking the convocation pledge in Sanskrit at the first convocation after the ISM attained IIT status in 2016.",
      "“The institution has set a new dress code for students for the convocation. Boys would wear pale white or pale cream kurta pyjama. Girls will wear off-white sari with matching clothes or off-white or pale cream salwar and kameez,” dean of infrastructure JK Patnayak said.",
      "Besides, all the students will carry a stole, Patnayak told reporters on the eve of the convocation.",
      "To a question, he said earlier the students used to wear ‘colonial’ gown during convocations, and now it has been changed to promote Indian traditional dresses.",
      "“The students will take pledge either in Sanskrit or in English at the convocation. Sanskrit has been adopted as it is a symbol of Indian culture,” Patnayak said.",
      "However, Sanskrit is not mandatory and a student can take pledge in English if he or she so prefers, he said.",
      "The ISM started its journey in 1926 and got IIT status in 2016. Till date, students used to wear gowns in convocations and take pledge only in English. The dean of infrastructure said 3,835 students of 2015-16 and 2016-17 sessions would be given degree during the convocation.",
      "“Altogether 1,500 of them have got registered to take the degree personally (in the dress directed by the ISM),” Patnayak said adding that IIT ISM director Rajiv Shekhar would present them degree.",
      "Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been scheduled to be the chief guest of the convocation on May 25. But his programme was cancelled at the eleventh hour due to some unavoidable circumstances, Patnayak said.",
      "Thereafter, the authorities rescheduled the programme and it would now be a two-day affair beginning Monday.",

      "They have been identified as Arun Kumar Singh, a third year computer science student and resident of Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh and Lawansh Sharma, a third year electrical engineering student from Madhya Pradesh.",
      "According to police and college authorities, the two, who were part of a four-member team of picnickers to Bhatinda Falls, were residing at Amber hostel.",
      "At the spot , Lavansh Sharma reportedly entered the restricted area to take selfie and slipped into the waterfall. Watching him struggle in the waters, Arun Kumar Singh jumped after him but he drowned too. Their companions, Ayush Kumar and Gopal Sharma, cried for help but in vain, said D Prasad, officer-in-charge of Putki police station.",
      "He said the police’s first priority was to retrieve the bodies. However, there was no success till late evening. The ISM administration too has sent a team led by its security officer Rahul Kumar to the spot “to recover the bodies of our students at the earliest,” said ISM registrat Col (Retd) MK Singh.",
      "In a similar incident in November 2011, two students of the college, Guturvira Ashok and Nand Dayal Gautam, had drowned in the waterfall while bathing.",

      "Published - December 06, 2018 07:11 pm IST - CHENNAI",
      "With 24 and 26 retractions in one year, Dr. Rashmi Madhuri and Dr. Prashant Sharma, who are Assistant Professors at Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad and coauthors in 40-odd papers, have the most retractions among researchers in India.",
      "A few days back, nine more papers were retracted for the same reason as the earlier ones — duplication of images and passing them off as different materials/experiments. Another paper was retracted in October 2018. The first paper by the duo was retracted in February this year, followed by seven more retractions in March and April 2018. Four more papers were retracted the very next month. There are still over a dozen problematic papers listed on Pubpeer website, which allows users to discuss and review scientific papers that have been published.",
      "The nine papers that were retracted a few days ago were published in RSC Advances (three papers), and one each appeared in Journal of Materials Chemistry A , Journal of Materials Chemistry B, Journal of Materials Chemistry C , Biomaterials Science and Chemical Engineering Journal. Another paper in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces was retracted in October 2018 and the paper in Chemical Engineering Journal was retracted in March 2018.",
      "The Royal Society of Chemistry, which publishes the journals that recently retracted the nine papers, told Retraction Watch: “The decision to retract is opposed by the authors, all of whom were contacted during the investigation process.",
      "“Our investigations concluded that in nine papers it was apparent that the data and conclusions could no longer be relied upon due to inappropriate altering of images and duplication of data, which have been presented in a number of journals, including with other publishers.”",
      "In August, Prof. Rajiv Shekhar, Director of IIT Dhanbad said the investigation into possible scientific misconduct by a four-member fact-finding committee formed by the institute was completed. He had said that the scientific misconduct appears serious and may attract major penalty. According to the report would be sent to the Baord, which was supposed to meet in September end.",
      "“The investigation is still on and will probably be completed by March-April [2019]. We are following due process,” said Prof. Shekhar.",
      "A November 2016 paper published in Chemical Engineering Journal and retracted in March 2017 was accepted as cover photo of the journal, according to Dr. Sharma.",
      "Unfortunately, an August 2014 paper published in the journal Biosensors & Bioelectronics and retracted by the journal in January 2015 was highlighted by Nature India in September 2014. The Nature India report was reproduced by the Swiss Innovation Foundation (Embassy of Switzerland in India). The retraction note says: “The article uses several electron micrographs which have been used in other publications as well, denoting different samples… This problem with the data casts doubt on all the data, and accordingly also the conclusions based on that data, in this publication.”",
      "Similarly, an October 2014 paper published in Analytica Chimica Acta and retracted in January 2015 was highlighted by Nature India in December 2014. The retraction note says: “The article reports different electron micrographs for different sample preparations, but some images are of different areas from the same sample…The article reports EDX spectra in Figure 5C and Figure 5D for samples that are reported as different…These problems with the data presented cast doubt on all the data, and accordingly also the conclusions based on that data, in this publication.”",
      "The recently retracted papers are:",
      "RSC Advances : Amino acid derived highly luminescent, heteroatom-doped carbon dots for label-free detection of Cd2+/Fe3+, cell imaging and enhanced antibacterial activity",
      "RSC Advances : Creation of ultrasound and temperature-triggered bubble liposomes from economical precursors to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin in cancer cells",

      "The Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, has officially withdrawn the mandatory attendance rule for all students. The decision, approved by the institute’s Senate, takes effect from the 2025–26 academic year.",
      "With this move, IIT ISM Dhanbad becomes the first of the 23 IITs to end the 75 per cent minimum attendance rule. From now on, undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students will be eligible to sit for end-semester examinations regardless of their attendance record.",
      "Students had been seeking changes to the previous policy, which required at least 75 per cent attendance to appear for final assessments. The institute has now confirmed that attendance will no longer be a condition for exam eligibility. However, instructors will continue to mark attendance through the digital platform, assisted by teaching staff.",
      "This change also applies to full-time PhD scholars for their coursework. Despite this, the institute has clarified that responsibilities tied to fellowships and assistantships remain unchanged. Stipend disbursements will still depend on departmental attendance norms.",
      "Additionally, students residing in hostels must continue to notify their wardens in writing if staying out overnight.",

      "On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh government had announced that it would bear Kumar's entire fee through scholarship."

    "paragraphs": [
      "After a Dalit student from Uttar Pradesh almost lost his IIT seat due to delayed fee payment, the state government plans to register all IITs, IIMs and other premier institutes with its Department of Social Welfare to provide scholarships to students.",
      "The first to be registered would be the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dhanbad, which was on Monday directed by the Supreme Court to admit the student, Atul Kumar (18), the son of a daily wager from Muzaffarnagar’s Titora village.",
      "Kumar lost his hard-earned seat in the Electrical Engineering branch at IIT Dhanbad as he missed the deadline to pay the admission fee of Rs 17,500 by a few minutes.",
      "On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh government had announced that it would bear Kumar’s entire fee through scholarship.",
      "The state government now plans to help all students like Kumar.",
      "“We will write to all such institutes of national importance, including IITs and IIMs, that are located outside the state for registration to enable seamless scholarship disbursement to all eligible candidates from the state who get admitted in these institutes,” Social Welfare Minister Asim Arun said.",
      "He said he spoke to the registrar of IIT Dhanbad and the institute is likely to be registered with the Department of Social Welfare by Thursday.",
      "“I have spoken to IIT Dhanbad authorities and hopefully by the time Atul reaches the institute, it would be registered with us, ensuring a smooth transfer of scholarship to him and all other eligible students from the state in future,” the minister said.",
      "“As of now, many of the institutes like IITs outside Uttar Pradesh aren’t registered with us. IIT Dhanbad wasn’t registered with us either.",
      "“So, I called up the institute’s registrar, who turned out to be from Kannauj (Arun’s assembly constituency). It has been decided that IIT Dhanbad would be registered with us immediately, possibly by Thursday, so that the channel for disbursing scholarships is quickly in place,” he added.",
      "Currently, three Uttar Pradesh government departments — Social Welfare, Backward Welfare and Minorities Welfare — disburse scholarships. The Department of Social Welfare is the nodal department for all scholarships and framing rules for it, Arun said.",
      "He said his department will also issue a “free-ship card” to Kumar.",
      "“This card facility, started this year itself, allows eligible students to enrol in an institution and on the basis of that card, this student will be able to secure what was earlier referred to as the zero-balance-admission,” the minister said.",
      "Earlier, Arun spoke to Kumar’s family over phone and assured them that the state government would provide financial assistance for his education.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The Law Commission has determined that the simultaneous elections Bills are constitutional and do not need state ratification. They do not impact voting rights or government accountability. The Model Code of Conduct does not need statutory recognition. However, the commission opposes a constructive no-confidence vote and codifying the poll code."

      "A research scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, allegedly committed suicide in his hostel room, officials said.",
      "The body of Ranjan Rathi, son of Udaybhan Singh Rathi and resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad, was found hanging in his hostel room located on the institute premises on Friday morning.",
      "Rathi was pursuing his doctorate in mechanical engineering after completing M.Tech from the same institute.",
      "According to the information available, the body was found after his roommate, who is a resident of Ranchi, tried to contact him on phone in the morning. But when he failed to get any response, he called another friend to check the whereabouts of Rathi.",
      "When his roommate’s friend knocked at the door without any reply, one of the hostel guards peered into the room from a ventilator and found Rathi hanging from the room ceiling. The students immediately informed the IIT-ISM officials, who called police which took the body for autopsy.",
      "“It’s shocking that a meritorious student committed suicide. However, the reason for act is not known. A committee would hold inquiry into the reasons behind the incident,” said IIT-ISM director Rajeev Shekhar.",
      "Meanwhile, Dhanbad police have seized Rathi’s mobile. Inspector Ashok Kumar said, “We are probing the case from all angles. His friends and roommate would also be interrogated.”",
      "Rathi’s parents have been informed and his father was on his way to Dhanbad.",
      "In another incident, three final year students of IIT-ISM were held on Thursday night on charges of misbehaving with girls near City centre. However, sources said they were released by police after taking an undertaking from them on the request of the IIT-ISM management.",

      "As many as 44 programmes offered by Indian higher education institutions in different disciplines have figured in the top 100 globally, according to QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023 released on Wednesday. Last year, 35 Indian programmes made it top-100.",
      "For the ‘subject ranking’, the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) ranks institutions on the basis of the individual programmes and compares them to other programmes in the world. For the 13th edition of QS subject ranking, the universities were ranked in five broader areas – Engineering and Technology, Arts and Humanities, Life Sciences and Medicine, Natural Science and Social Sciences and Management.",
      "While the rankings cover 54 academic disciplines, the Indian higher education institutions have performed well in the fields of Computer Science, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Business Studies, and Physics, states a statement released by QS Quacquarelli Symonds.",
      "The mathematics programme offered by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Bombay made it to the global top 100 categories by scoring the 92nd spot. IIT Delhi’s Electrical engineering programme broke into the top 50 categories globally, placed 49th, while the same programme offered by IIT Kanpur has been placed 87th, featuring in the top 100 categories for the first time.",
      "“Jawaharlal Nehru University breaks into the world’s top 100 in Sociology, taking 68th place, showing a rise of 33 places. The University of Delhi also joins the world’s top echelon in Sociology, in rank 91,” the QS said.",
      "According to the statement, the 11 Institutes of Eminence (IoE), including both IIT-Delhi and IIT-Bombay, that were declared by the government in 2018 for upgrade to world class status constituted 44% of the overall Indian entries (158) this year. “Five and a half years after the inception of India’s Institutes of Eminence scheme, its varsities continue to show a steady improvement in the rankings, with 70% of their entries rising or remaining stable,” the statement read.",
      "Among the IoE, the majority of the institutes saw more courses offered by them gaining places compared to ones that slipped. However, in the case of the Delhi University (DU), which was the most representative university from the county, of the 27 programmes featured in the QS list, seven improved ranks, while 12 declined.",
      "For the second consecutive year, the dentistry programme offered by the Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences in Chennai stood out as the best performing institution among Indian institutes and secured 13th rank globally. Last year, it was ranked 18th.",
      "“It is the only Indian university to achieve a perfect score (100/100) in both Citations per Paper and H Index. The next two highest ranked universities in these tables are the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) placed 21st in Petroleum Engineering (up 9 places) and the Indian School of Mines (ISM) University, Dhanbad, placed 25th (up one place) in Engineering – Mineral and Mining,” the QS said in a statement.",
      "India is the second most represented country in Asia for the number of ranked universities (66), after China (Mainland) (99), and the fourth most represented country for the overall number of entries across the 54 narrow subjects (314) after China (Mainland), South Korea and Japan.",
      "QS Research Director, Ben Sowter, said that several programs at India’s privately-run Institutes of Eminence have made progress this year, demonstrating the positive role that well-regulated private provision can have in enhancing India’s higher education sector. “The 20 private institutions featured in this edition, total 66 entries, including 21 ranked for the first time, and all bar four either rise or remain stable compared to last year’s edition. Considering only countries with more than ten universities ranked in our ranking, India is the second-most improved in Asia. Its overall performance in these tables improved by 17.2% year on year, after Mainland China which improved by 21.9%,” he said.",
      "The QS highlighted that, globally, India, which saw its research output grow by 54% between 2017 and 2022, produces the world’s fourth most research (1.3 million academic papers between 2017 and 2022), behind world leader China (4.5 million), the United States (4.4 million) and the United Kingdom (1.4 million).",
      "However, in citation count, India lags far behind. “From 2017 to 2021, India saw 15% of its publications cited in top journals. Meanwhile, its closest competitors in terms of research output volume, the United Kingdom and Germany boast top journal citation percentages more than double that, 38% and 33% respectively,” the QS said.",
      "PV Rao, Head, Ranking Cell at IIT Delhi said, “IIT Delhi is among the top fifty institutions globally in the area of Engineering & Technology and also five programmes offered by the institute have achieved top hundred ranks globally in the QS World University Rankings by Subject, which is a phenomenal achievement”.",
      "According to the methodology of the rankings shared by the QS, five components are used to rank universities including academic reputation, employer reputation research citations per paper, H-index, and international research network. The h-index is a way of measuring both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or scholar. Responses were drawn from over 1,30,000  academics worldwide, the QS said.",

      "At a knowledge-exchange programme held on 7 November in Tromsø, Norway, Prof. Krishna Agarwal—Founder & CEO of Spermotile and Professor at UiT The Arctic University of Norway—presented Norway’s cutting-edge approaches to health innovation and translational science to a visiting Indian parliamentary delegation. The programme, moderated by ProTromsø, introduced the delegation to the Arctic capital’s ecosystem of education, research excellence, green economy, maritime innovation, and human-centric governance. The Indian delegation included five Members of Parliament : Mr. Anup Sanjay Dhotre , Mr. Putta Mahesh Kumar , Mr. Sirgapoor Niranjan Reddy , Mr. Gowaal Kagada Padavi , and Ms. Priya Saroj , 26, currently the youngest MP in the Lok Sabha. Representatives from UN Women and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi also participated in the visit.",
      "Spermotile CEO, Prof. Krishna Agarwal representing UiT The Arctic University of Norway",
      "Prof. Agarwal , who leads UiT’s growing visual-AI and medtech innovation activities, presented Spermotile , the award-winning device to improve sperm selection during IVF/ICSI. Using AI-enabled motion characterization and microfluidic design, Spermotile aims to enhance clinical outcomes while reducing variability in andrology labs.",
      "Her academic journey began in India, where she earned the Gold Medal at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad , later receiving the Prestigious President’s Graduate Fellowship during her PhD at the National University of Singapore. This was followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the Singapore-MIT Alliance , where she further deepened her expertise in computational imaging and biophysical modelling. Over her career, she has accumulated over ten global accolades , including the URSI Young Scientist Award and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.",
      "Now based in the extreme Arctic North, Prof. Agarwal has secured over €23 million in research and innovation funding, building a multicultural team of 20 researchers working across AI, optics, microscopy, and reproductive medicine. She emphasized to the MPs how the Indo-Singapore-Nordic scientific continuum shaped her ability to build a thriving deep-tech ecosystem within Tromsø’s unique innovation culture.",
      "The MPs engaged extensively with her demonstration, noting the significance of precision fertility technologies for India, where IVF/ICSI demand continues to rise. The session also offered them an opportunity to study Norway’s research-to-innovation pipeline, Arctic health-research priorities, and mechanisms that integrate academia, industry, and regional health authorities.",
      "Prof. Agarwal’s participation strengthened Indo-Norwegian collaboration in health innovation and highlighted the growing global role of Arctic research environments in shaping the next generation of medical technologies.",

      "In a moment that restored his fading hopes, 18-year-old Atul Kumar stood before the Supreme Court on Monday as a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud delivered a verdict that would change the course of his life. Denied admission to IIT-Dhanbad for missing a fee payment deadline by mere minutes, Atul’s future had seemed bleak. But in an extraordinary move, the apex court exercised its special powers to ensure that the talented young boy from a marginalised community would not lose his hard-earned seat.",
      "The bench, also comprising justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, ordered the IIT seat allocation authority to admit Atul into the electronics engineering programme at IIT- Dhanbad, recognising Atul’s remarkable potential and the hardships he had endured due to financial constraints.",
      "“We are of the view that a talented student like the petitioner, who also belongs to a marginalised section, cannot be left in the lurch. The power under Article 142 has to be used to do justice in cases like these,” held the bench, ensuring that Atul’s journey would not end due to a lack of ₹ 17,500. It added that if needed, IIT will add a new seat to accommodate Atul in the current batch and that he would also be eligible to hostel facilities.",
      "Atul, present in the courtroom during the hearing, remained composed as the bench examined his case. His story had already garnered significant attention - an 18-year-old Dalit boy from Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, who had cleared one of the toughest entrance exams in India but missed the chance to pay the acceptance fee by a few minutes. His family, struggling with severe financial constraints, had cobbled together the money by borrowing from neighbours. But the online portal for IIT-Dhanbad logged him out just before he could complete the payment.",
      "In court, the IIT counsel raised objections, claiming that Atul had been idle on the website for two hours, suggesting negligence. But the bench was quick to dismiss this claim, instead pointing out the more pressing issue: “The boy simply did not have the money in time. If he had ₹ 17,500, why would he not pay? This is the last thing he would do to lose his seat,” the CJI retorted.",
      "Throughout the proceedings, the bench expressed its intent to do justice. CJI Chandrachud, known for his sensitivity in such cases, remarked: “Some places, teachers help; some places, judges help.” The bench made it clear that they were not just addressing the legal technicalities but ensuring that Atul’s potential was not wasted.",
      "At the end of the hearing, the CJI, with a smile, addressed Atul directly: “All the best! Achha kariye (Do well),” wishing him success in the journey that now lay ahead. With a smile of his own and folded hands, Atul expressed his gratitude to the court, acknowledging that the verdict had saved not just his academic future, but his family’s hopes as well.",
      "Atul’s legal journey had been a difficult one. Initially, he approached the Jharkhand high court, which suggested filing a petition in the Madras high court since IIT Madras was the JEE Advanced exam conducting authority for this year. After delays and uncertainty, Atul turned to the Supreme Court, where his case was taken up with urgency.",
      "His lawyers Amol Chitale and Pragya Baghel drew on the parallels with a 2021 case where another Dalit student, Prince Jaibir Singh, had been allowed admission to IIT Bombay after missing a payment deadline.",
      "Chitale emphasised that for Atul and his family, the decision was a lifeline. His father, a part-time tailor and daily wage labourer, had always emphasised education despite their financial hardships. With one brother already studying at IIT-Kharagpur and another at NIT Hamirpur, the family had pinned their hopes on Atul’s success, the lawyer pointed out during the proceedings.",
      "Now, with the Supreme Court’s intervention, their dreams are back on track. After the order, Atul left with a renewed sense of hope.",
      "“Our dream train was off the track for some time but with the Supreme Court’s intervention and exercise of its power under Article 142, it is back on track,” said Atul, adding he now wishes to move forward, ready to embrace the opportunity that almost slipped through his fingers.",

      "DHANBAD STUDENTS DEVELOP COMMUNITY-BASED PORTAL",
      "VISITORS CAN MAKE CHANGES TO THE PORTAL"
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "Three students of B Tech final year of IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, Jharkhand, have developed a web portal that collects and displays pan-India Covid resources and information in a structured manner. The website provides information about hospital bed availability, plasma, medicines, oxygen, ambulance, and other resources for Covid patients and their families across the country. IIT Dhanbad students between the age of 20 to 23 are working on this website.",
      "As the country battles with the second wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic, various states have been reporting acute shortage of oxygen cylinders and hospital beds. Web portals like these help Covid-affected people and their families get verified information.",
      "",
      "23-year-old boy Mayank Roy, along with two of his friends, has developed a website, which he claims is a community-based portal. Speaking about the same, he told IndiaToday.in, \"There have been many portals launched by many people to help with Covid resources, which is great. But the resources available there have been collected by the person who created the portal and only they get to edit it. The idea behind our portal was to have a community-based portal. It is a Covid resource portal by the people and for the people. So, the resources available there will be contributed by the community itself.\"",
      "If the visitors on the website have a link for oxygen beds or plasma availability, they can add it to the website. \"We have a team of moderators, who will verify that the link is working and is not spam, and then it will be made public within 24 hours. Here, the community is contributing to it rather than just the website developers gathering resources. We also have a feedback option. It can happen that a link posted three weeks ago isn't working. We have an edit option. Using that you can either find a new link to that resource, or you can ask to replace or remove the link as it's not working, which will be then verified and taken care of within 24 hours,\" said Mayank, who hails from Siliguri.",
      "",
      "Currently, the Covid portal has four people working on it. They are all B Tech final year students of IIT Dhanbad. \"This portal was a brainchild of two of my friends, Prateek Divyanshu and Tazril Parveez Ali, who started working on it on May 3. Within a couple of days, I joined them since I am good at content writing and could help them with spreading the word. After we launched the website on May 9, Suyog Jadhav joined us, who helps us with the server.\"",
      "Here's a look at the user interface of the web portal:",
      "",
      "Speaking about the motivation behind the website, Mayank said, \"My dad and I had Covid in December 2020. Thankfully we didn't face any shortage of beds or any resources, but it helped us empathise more with the people right now. Prateek, who is one of the co-founders - his family was also infected with Covid-19 just a couple of weeks before we started working on this portal. It helped us connect more with the people right now. Being IITians, we have the privilege of having the knowledge to inculcate our skills and get this ahead of others. It will only be fair to give something back to the society.\"",
      "The portal is hardly a week old and Mayank and his friends are working to make it more useful for people. They are currently in the second phase of the website's development and are still adding new features to it. \"Initially, when we launched the website, we had 500-600 users on the first day itself. Right now, we have 100-200 people every day. We are working on the second phase of our development. Earlier, we didn't have a live bed tracker on our website, we have added that through official government sources. We are also hiring volunteers. We will divide the states among these volunteers, and they will be in charge of uploading the resources.\"",

      "Over the past five days, the Balasore district administration in Odisha has gone overboard in tightening the noose around minor mineral smugglers, seizing 138 vehicles, and clamping prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC at 28 places while putting Divisional Railway Manager of Kharagpur on notice.",
      "The crackdown on part of the administration encapsulates the magnitude of illegalities prevailing in the sector.",
      "The administration was propelled into action in the tiny district bordering West Bengal after Kunal Motiram Chavan, a 2020-batch IAS officer, was attacked by sand mafia earlier this week. Multiple cases were lodged against mafias dealing with minor minerals; brick kilns were demolished.",
      "As per order of National Green Tribunal, minor mineral sources were not auctioned to lessees. However, steep demand for critical components in infrastructure development and housing has forced operators to go for extraction of minor minerals, especially sand. Emboldened by slack enforcement and little to no surveillance by revenue officials, smugglers have had their way around the district.",
      "Long before the present drive — Sandstorm — was launched, the State government had identified Nilagiri block of Balasore as extremely prone to minor mineral theft. In June last year, it decided to keep police force deployed in Nilagiri to stop smuggling.",
      "The State government had fixed the revenue collection target at ₹1,500 crore for the fiscal 2022-23. Due to illegal mining and non-auctioning of minor mineral sources, only ₹512.62 crore was collected in the first eight months of the current financial year. More than 65% of annual target remains to be achieved.",
      "While the illegal mining of sand does not affect the State’s revenue collection, it has had an adverse impact on local ecology and riparian community.",
      "“There is no monitoring by pollution control board, considering sand mining poses a threat to the embankment, [leads to] loss of revenue, [is a] violation of mining plan and standard environment clearance conditions, and damages the riparian ecology,” Shankar Pani, an environmental lawyer, notes.",
      "Mining of minor minerals is allowed only if the District Survey Report (DSR) is finalised. Balasore is yet to get its DSR. While there is a provision for mining of sand using only manual method, the use of mechanical methods with earthmovers — in violation of mining plan, environmental clearance and consent to operate conditions — is visible all across the State.",
      "The two major rivers flowing through Balasore — Subarnarekha and Burhabalanga — have suffered much because of it. According to Mr. Chavan, the Burhabalanga’s riverbed is particularly worse in the Dahapada and Balighat areas. “Sand acts as a sponge in riverbed. Machines were used to extract sand beyond its permissible limit. If sand is taken out, river water will flow down at much faster rate. In the event of flood, there is every possibility of water entering newer areas,” he explains.",
      "An expert committee comprising scientists from Central Pollution Control Board, IIT-ISM, Dhanbad, West Bengal Pollution Control Board and Odisha State Pollution Control Board appointed by NGT also pointed to this problem, saying, “Sand mining takes place over a stretch of about 26.1 km of Subarnarekha River. About 12.3-km stretch lies on the inter-State boundary of Odisha-West Bengal and remaining stretch of about 13.8 km is in Odisha. Extensive erosion has been noticed of the river.”",
      "The total area permitted by Odisha and West Bengal for sand mining came to 109.185 hectare in 2019. This was only 35% of the total area in which mining takes place.",
      "Massive stone and morrum (laterite soil) quarries were noticed in 12 blocks of Balasore. District police also seized two railway wagons filled with morrum being transported from the district. Vast stretches of government wasteland were misused to manufacture bricks. The soil required for brick-making used to be extracted illegally. Odisha is now toying with the idea of tracking vehicles smuggling minor minerals through usage of GPS and i4MS, an online system, for managing minerals.",
      "Meanwhile, a woman revenue inspector was allegedly attacked by villagers after a laterite stone-laden tractor hit a boundary wall of a temple on Friday. She had been chasing the vehicle.",

      "Atul Kumar, who had lost his seat at IIT Dhanbad, to study at IIT with a full scholarship from the U.P. government.\n                                          | Photo Credit: PTI",
      "Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday (October 2, 2024) said it will help Dalit student Atul Kumar, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, to get admission in Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dhanbad and its social welfare department will bear the entire fee through scholarship. Atul Kumar, the son of daily wage labourer’s admission got stuck due to non-payment of fees by June 24. Later the admission was secured after the intervention of the Supreme Court.",
      "“Through the State’s scholarship scheme, the Social Welfare Department will cover his full tuition fees. As part of this initiative, not only will Atul’s fees be covered, but the scholarship will also extend to cover all expenses incurred during his four years of study,” a statement issued by the U.P. government reads.",
      "U.P. Social Welfare Department Minister Asim Arun contacted Atul Kumar’s family via telephone, assuring them that the U.P. government would provide all the financial support for the student’s educational journey. State government-initiated contact with IIT Dhanbad to facilitate the completion of the admission process.",
      "The Supreme Court on September 30 directed the IIT Dhanbad to admit Mr. Kumar, who lost out on his seat after failing by a few minutes to meet the deadline to pay the requisite fee of ₹17,500. “We are of the view that a talented student should not be left in the lurch. We direct that admission be granted to him in IIT Dhanbad,” ordered a bench of Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra. The bench asked the IIT to admit the student in the same batch and directed to create a supernumerary seat for him, adding that no existing student should be disturbed in the admission process.",

      "ISM had been fighting for an IIT tag since 2013.",
      "The institute was promised it would get the label so that it gets better placement opportunities, more research funds from the government, better opportunities for international collaborations, and a positive change in perception.",
      "Last year, several students of the premiere institute had also taken to the streets against the delay in the upgrade.",
      "Over one thousand students had demonstrated at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in 2013 and got huge support from the political leaders especially MPs across the country.",
      "The institute was formally opened on December 9, 1926, by Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India to address the need for trained manpower related to mining activities in the country with disciplines of Mining and Applied Geology.",
      "Earlier on April 8, Union HRD minister Smriti Irani on her visit to ISM had assured students an IIT tag would be announced soon.",

      "QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023: IIT Bombay’s Mathematics programme at 92nd place, JNU’s sociology at 68th place are some of the courses that featured in the QS World University Rankings 2023 by subject. Apart from these 10 entries from BITS Pilani and two from OP Jindal university also made it to top 100.",
      "Led by its Institutes of Eminence (IoE), India has improved its position in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings by Subject, with 44 courses, in their respective subject categories, offered in the country’s higher educational institutes ranked among the global top 100.",
      "The rankings, released on Wednesday, show that the 11 declared Institutes IoEs account for 44 per cent of the 355 programmes offered by Indian universities which made it to the overall rankings. In the previous round, there were 299 entries, including 35 among the top 100.",
      "While the rankings cover 54 academic disciplines, the Indian universities perform well in the fields of Computer Science, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Business Studies, and Physics.",
      "Among the IOEs, barring Delhi Universities, the other institutes saw more courses offered by them gaining places compared to ones that slipped. However, in the case of DU, of the 27 programmes featured in the QS list, seven improved ranks, while 12 declined.",
      "For the second consecutive year, the dentistry programme offered by the Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences posted the best performance among Indian institutes obtaining the 13th rank globally. Last year, it was ranked 18th.",
      "“It is the only Indian university to achieve a perfect score (100/100) in both Citations per Paper and H Index. The next two highest ranked universities in these tables are the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) placed 21st in Petroleum Engineering (up 9 places) and the Indian School of Mines (ISM) University, Dhanbad, placed 25th (up one place) in Engineering – Mineral and Mining,” the QS said in a statement.",
      "The QS noted that, globally, India, which saw its research output grow by 54% between 2017 and 2022, produces the world’s fourth most research (1.3 million academic papers between 2017 and 2022), behind world leader China (4.5 million), the United States (4.4 million) and the United Kingdom (1.4 million).",
      "But in citation count, India lags far behind. “From 2017 to 2021, India saw 15% of its publications cited in top journals. Meanwhile, its closest competitors in terms of research output volume, the United Kingdom and Germany boast top journal citation percentages more than double that, 38% and 33% respectively,” the QS pointed out.",
      "The highlights of the 2023 rankings include the entry of IIT Bombay’s Mathematics programme in the global top 100 categories, getting the 92nd spot. IIT Delhi’s Electrical engineering programme broke into the top 50 categories globally, placed 49th, while the same programme offered by IIT Kanpur has been placed 87th, featuring in the top 100 categories for the first time.",
      "“Jawaharlal Nehru University breaks into the world’s top 100 in Sociology, taking 68th place, showing a rise of 33 places. The University of Delhi also joins the world’s top echelon in Sociology, in rank 91,” added the QS.",
      "The organisation’s Research Director Ben Sowter said among countries having over 10 universities featured in the rankings, “India is the second-most improved in Asia with its overall performance improving by 17.2% year on year, after Mainland China which improved by 21.9%.”",

      "Over 40% of teaching posts in all 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are vacant, according to data provided by the Ministry of Education in the Lok Sabha to a question raised by Congress member Shashi Tharoor.",
      "According to the data, while 6,511 teaching faculty are working in the IITs, 4,370 posts are vacant..",
      "The data once again highlighted the poor representation of faculty from reserved categories. Only 12% of the 6,511 teaching staff are from Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). The Ministry did not provide category-wise break down of the faculty strength. However, an earlier reply submitted in December 2021 showed that there were only 32 faculty members from ST, 183 from SC, and 462 from OBC communities.",
      "As per the reservation policies, the SCs, STs, OBCs, and the EWS should be provided a reservation of 7.5%, 15%, 27% and 10% respectively. This would mean that ideally at least 59.5% of the faculty must be from reserved categories.",
      "Among the older and bigger IITs, IIT (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad had 57.2% of posts vacant, followed by 53.4% in IIT Kharagpur. IIT Delhi was the exception with just 9.4% of the posts vacant. However, the institution had one of the lowest representation of faculty from reserved categories (6.5%). IIT Bombay had the poorest representation with just 3.8% of its 693 faculty members from reserved categories.",
      "Mr. Tharoor’s questions were about the vacancies, student to faculty ratio and the measures being taken to fill the vacancies. The Ministry, in its reply, pointed to the ongoing special recruitment drive under “mission mode” from September 2021 to September 2022 to fill the vacancies under the reserved categories.",
      "However, the special recruitment drive has already come under criticism as the problems posed by the flexible cadre structure in IITs have not been addressed. As per the flexible cadre structure, the sanctioned faculty strength is not fixed at each category, viz. Assistant Professors, Associate Professors and Professors but only at the overall level. Until recently, IITs were implementing reservation only at the level of Assistant Professor.",
      "Rajesh Paswan, convener of the Delhi-based Joint Forum for Academic and Social Justice (JFASJ), an organisation fighting for the implementation of reservation policies in higher education institutions, said the present numbers on faculty from reserved categories itself were misleading. “Until the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers' Cadre) Act came into force, IITs were hardly implementing reservation. Hence many of the faculty members must have been recruited under general category,” he said.",

      "The Supreme Court on Monday came to the rescue of a student, the son of a daily wager and a member of a Scheduled Caste community, who missed admission to the Indian Institute of Technology (Dhanbad) due to his inability to pay ₹17,500 as fees on time before the admission portal closed.",
      "“He is a brilliant student. No child seeking education should go back disappointed from the Supreme Court,” Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, heading a three-judge Bench, said.",
      "The court exercised its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution to open the doors of IIT Dhanbad to Atul Kumar, who was present in the courtroom.",
      "Mr. Kumar had secured a rank of 1,455 for the JEE (Advanced) 2024 exam in his category. He had been allotted a seat at IIT Dhanbad for the four-year Bachelor of Technology course in the Electrical Engineering. It was his second and final shot at securing admission.",
      "The court noted that Mr. Kumar had struggled against the odds of his life to achieve his dream to study at an IIT. The family income was below the poverty line. He had studied in a higher secondary school at Khatauli, Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Kumar’s two brothers are studying at IIT Kharagpur and NIT Hamirpur.",
      "On June 24, he had logged in to the admission portal after his parents somehow managed to collect ₹17,500. However, the portal closed by the time he could complete filling in his details. After his attempts to communicate his quandary with the exam authority IIT Madras, Mr. Kumar approached the Madras High Court through legal aid. The High Court advised him to appeal to the Supreme Court for relief.",
      "“Affirmatively, he is a talented student who belongs to a marginalised community and who has done everything to secure admission. Our power to do substantive justice under Article 142 is precisely for situations like this,” the Chief Justice noted. “All the best,” he wished Mr. Kumar at the end of the hearing.",

      "New Delhi: The Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad has announced a ‘no mandatory attendance’ policy, allowing students to appear for examinations irrespective of their attendance starting from the academic year 2025–26.",
      "In a first for any of the 23 IITs, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad has said that its undergraduate (UG), postgraduate (PG), and doctor of philosophy (PhD) students will not be penalised “in any form based on the minimum attendance criteria,” which was 75% until the previous academic year, 2024–25.",
      "The notification comes more than a week after the IIT Dhanbad senate, in its September 1 meeting, approved a proposal put forward by the office-bearers of the Student Gymkhana (SG) to remove mandatory attendance. The senates of IITs are the institutes’ highest academic bodies, which hold the authority to approve academic policies.",
      "IIT Dhanbad dean (academic) Mritunjay Kumar Singh, said that the decision to remove mandatory attendance is meant to give students “greater liberty” to engage their potential outside the classroom in technical and socio-cultural clubs. “The focus here is on clubs, as they help students build skills beyond the structured curriculum,” he told HT.",
      "Akshaya Jha, a third-year of BTech student of IIT Dhanbad, said that the removal of mandatory attendance hasn’t made “much difference” to her since she attends classes regularly out of habit.",
      "IITs follow varying attendance rules. IIT Guwahati, Kharagpur, Delhi, and Roorkee mandate 75% attendance, while Madras and Palakkad require 85% minimum attendance to be eligible for examinations. IIT Gandhinagar leaves it to instructors, but students missing too many early classes are barred from quizzes and mid-semester examinations.",
      "IIT Dhanbad convened its senate meeting for 2025–26 a month after union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan’s visit on July 31 and August 1.“The proposal to remove mandatory attendance came from the Students’ Gymkhana. Many students were sitting in class just to mark attendance, without real learning. We felt that time could be better used for skill development. Since placements in IITs depend more on skills than classroom presence, we pushed for this change,” chairperson of the Students’ Gymkhana Nakshatra Singh Jhala said.",
      "He added that the matter was also discussed with minister Pradhan during his visit.",
      "Pradhan, in his address at the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2025 rankings event on September 4, said, “Why stress on attendance in higher education? Students who clear the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) don’t need to be monitored this way—we must trust them and relax attendance norms.”",
      "“Although the minimum attendance rule for examination has been scrapped, as a safeguard to curb misuse, the instructors will still record class attendance, and students have to meet departmental attendance norms to remain eligible for stipends and fellowships,” The IIT Dhanbad dean said.",
      "“The institute will regularly review how students are utilising their time—whether for ideation, innovation, or skill-building—and how this contributes to their overall development. As this reform has only just been implemented, the institute plans to assess its outcomes after one trimester or a couple of semesters. The goal is to evaluate whether the policy is achieving what was intended and helping students in meaningful ways,” he added.",

      "The Federation of Minor Minerals Industry (FEMMI), in association with NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Mines, will host a national conference on ‘Opportunities and Challenges in Minor Minerals’ in Vijayawada on March 7. It is expected to benefit the industry as key policymakers and experts, including NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat, Andhra Pradesh Principal Secretary of Mines Praveen Kumar, and IIT (ISM Dhanbad) professor R.M. Bhattacharjee, will participate in the day-long discussions, said FEMMI secretary general Ch. Rao.",
      "Currently, the mining industry is facing several challenges such as fluctuating policies, bureaucratic delays in sanctioning of permissions, excessive taxation, and flaws in the auction system. Support from both the Centre and State government are necessary to bring about reforms in the minor mineral industry, which plays a key role in infrastructure, construction and manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Rao said government support will revive the industry across the country. He pointed out that around half of the minor mineral mines remain non-operational in the country. As many as 50% of the 4,000-plus mines were closed in Andhra Pradesh alone. Small and medium entrepreneurs are facing untold miseries with multiple challenges for the past few years. Thousands of employees and workers also lost their livelihood due to the crisis in the mining industry.",
      "“As India advances towards its long term industrial development goals, the minor mineral sector needs support from both the Union and State governments. We hope the conference will lay a foundation for a transparent, efficient and investment-friendly mining framework in AP as well as other parts of the country,” he added while speaking to mediapersons here.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Prime Minister Narendra Modi walk through the gardens at Raj Bhavan on October 9, 2025, in Mumbai\n                                          | Photo Credit: via Reuters",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart, U.K. PM Keir Starmer, hailed the partnership between the two countries and underlined that the growing partnership is crucial for global stability and economic progress in the era of global instability.",
      "“India and the U.K. are natural partners. In the current era of global instability, this partnership remains a vital pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Mr. Modi, adding that the government is working to combine the U.K.’s industrial expertise and R&D with India’s talent and scale.",
      "U.K. PM Starmer in India LIVE updates - October 9, 2025",
      "A joint statement by Mr. Starmer and Mr. Modi focused on India-U.K. relations, economic progress, global stability, defence co-production, and potential for technology partnerships between both countries. The joint statement reiterated the advantages of the recently signed U.K.-India Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and initiatives launched, supporting innovators and entrepreneurs.",
      "Mr. Modi called CETA “historic”, saying this agreement will reduce import costs, create new employment opportunities for youth, boost trade, and benefit both our industries and consumers. Mr Modi said, “Mr. Starmer’s visit symbolises the new energy and broad vision in the India-U.K. partnership.”",
      "Mr. Keir Starmer called CETA a “breakthrough” moment, saying it was in the making for years, slashing tariffs, which will increase access to each other’s markets and make life better for both nations.",
      "This is Mr. Starmer’s first visit to India after being appointed as the U.K. Prime Minister. Along with the delegation of over 100 entrepreneurs, cultural representatives, and university Vice-Chancellors, he has been on a two-day visit to India to discuss the CETA that the countries signed on 24 July, the negotiations for which were launched on 13 January 2022.",
      "Keir Starmer is greeted by Narendra Modi in Mumbai\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                via Reuters",
      "The countries also signed the Terms of Reference to reposition the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO). Union Minister Piyush Goyal said on X, “This institutional reset is a game-changer, strengthening our framework for strategic engagement, driving the implementation of the India-U.K. CETA, and boosting our joint ambition to significantly enhance our bilateral trade.”",
      "Both leaders discussed the issues of the Indo-Pacific region and committed to increase maritime security cooperation in the region. Behind the closed doors, the peace and stability in West Asia, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and the Gaza conflict were also discussed. “India supports all efforts to restore peace through dialogue and diplomacy,” Mr. Modi added.",
      "Welcoming the news of the first stage of the peace plan in Gaza, Mr. Starmer expressed his gratitude towards Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, the United States and others for the diplomatic efforts. “We will support this to implement the full peace plan. There is also a need for lasting peace in Ukraine,” he added.",
      "Mr. Starmer also touched on strong cooperation in areas such as climate and energy, and defence. “Our Carrier Strike Group is exercising with the Indian Navy, reflecting the strength,” he added.",
      "India launched several initiatives in collaboration with the U.K., one being the India-U.K. Technology Security Initiative. “Under this initiative, we have created a platform for joint research and innovation in critical technologies and use it as a bridge between the young generations of both countries,” Mr. Modi said.",
      "The other initiatives include the Connectivity and Innovation Centre, the Joint AI Research Centre, the Industry Guild and the Supply Chain Observatory to collaborate on critical minerals, with a satellite campus at ISM Dhanbad, the formation of the India-U.K. Offshore Wind Taskforce, and the Climate Technology Startup Fund, supporting innovators and entrepreneurs from both countries working in climate, technology, and AI.",
      "From defence and security, to education and innovation – new dimensions are being created in the relationship between India and the U.K. Mr. Starmer said, “Nine university campuses will be opened in India.” “Southampton University’s campus is already open in Gurugram. The construction of three other U.K. universities’ campuses is also underway in GIFT City,” said Mr. Modi.",

      "The Centre has named seven academic institutions, including four IITs, as Centres of Excellence (CoEs) under the National Critical Mineral Mission, aiming to push forward research and innovation in key raw materials needed for clean energy, space, electronics and defence.",
      "The decision, approved by the Project Approval and Advisory Committee on Thursday, was formally announced by the Ministry of Mines on Friday.",
      "",
      "Among the seven institutions, four are Indian Institutes of Technology, IIT Bombay, IIT Hyderabad, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, and IIT Roorkee.",
      "",
      "The other institutes will be named in the coming days.",
      "",
      "Each will function as a Centre of Excellence to lead focused research in identifying, sourcing, and processing minerals vital to sectors like clean energy, electronics, defence, and space.",
      "These centres will not work in isolation. Each CoE will follow a hub-and-spoke model, bringing together a consortium of researchers and labs to strengthen India’s scientific base in critical mineral technologies.",
      "",
      "The goal is to combine the specialised skills of multiple institutions under one coordinated programme.",
      "The Ministry had earlier invited proposals from interested institutions. A two-stage evaluation process followed, looking at technical strength, past research work, and relevance to national needs.",
      "The Centres of Excellence are part of the broader National Critical Mineral Mission, approved by the Union Cabinet in January this year. The mission runs from 2024-25 to 2030–31, with the larger aim of reducing the country's import dependence in key raw materials and building domestic capacity in areas like rare earths, lithium, and cobalt.",
      "Critical minerals are essential for technologies that support energy transition, such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. They also play a vital role in semiconductors, satellites, and communication equipment.",
      "India currently imports a large share of these raw materials.",
      "The new mission focuses on exploring domestic reserves, improving refining techniques, and encouraging sustainable practices in extraction.",
      "By turning top research institutes into focused centres, the government hopes to fill knowledge gaps and develop home-grown solutions.",
      "The CoEs are expected to provide technical inputs for policy and help industries adopt better sourcing and production methods.",
      "The move comes at a time when many countries are reassessing their critical mineral supply chains. India’s response, through a coordinated R&D approach, reflects a shift from reliance to readiness.",

      "Who was Jaswant Singh Gill?",
      "What happened at the Mahabir Colliery in West Bengal in November 1989?"
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "After Mission Mangal and Kesari, actor Akshay Kumar is on a new mission in his upcoming film, Mission Raniganj: The Great Bharat Rescue. He will be reprising the role of mining expert, Jaswant Singh Gill in the film, written by Vipul K Rawal and directed by Tinu Suresh Desai. The trailer of the film offered a glimpse into the real story of Gill rescuing 65 miners from a flooded mine in Raniganj, West Bengal.",
      "What makes the incident important? Why did people celebrate Gill after the rescue mission, and why did he win ‘Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak’ from the then President of India, Ramaswamy Venkataraman? The indianexpress.com explains.",
      "Born in Amritsar in 1940, Jaswant Singh Gill studied at Khalsa School and later took admission in BSc (non-medical) at Khalsa College (Amritsar). He studied BSc (Honours) from the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, before joining Coal India Limited in 1973. Throughout his tenure, he kept growing in ranks from 1-9 and ultimately retired in 1998 as Engineer-in-chief. The most significant event of his over two-decade career was the rescue mission at the Mahabir Colliery, Raniganj, West Bengal. He saved the lives of 65 miners who were trapped in a flooded coal mine. He also got the moniker of Capsule Gill after the incident.",
      "On November 13, 1989, 232 miners were employed in the night shift to work towards the rise-most area of the 320-foot-deep mine to excavate coal through explosions. At around 4 am, there was a sudden influx of water, and the mine got flooded. The 161 miners who were near the two lifts in the pit could be rescued immediately, but 71 of them were far off and couldn’t reach the lift due to the water. Fortunately, there was a telephone connection between the borehole and the surface, through which a message was sent that 65 miners had taken shelter at a rise part of the pit, but six of them had gone missing.",
      "On learning about the trapped miners, the authorities formed four teams to rescue them. Three out of the four teams started trying various methods to bring out the miners. Several submersible pumps were inserted in the mine to reduce the water level, but the water kept recirculating inside the mine and the pumped-out water was finding its way back through cracks in the surface. Meanwhile, the oxygen level in the mine was depleting too, and the mine could collapse at any time.",
      "Senior engineer Jasawant Gill, who was a part of the fourth team, came up with an idea that nobody could have imagined. “My father started to innovate on a theoretical idea that had never been put to practical use. It involved fabricating a steel capsule about 7 feet high and 22 inches in diameter, creating a new borehole to lower the capsule into the mine and taking out the miners, one by one,” Sarpreet Singh Gill, son of Jaswant Gill, shared with The Tribune.",
      "The steel capsule was constructed in 72 hours and after a few trial runs up and down the borehole, rescue of men began on November 16 at 2.30 am. Gill insisted on going into the capsule himself to bring out the trapped men. After initial opposition from the top officials of Coal India Limited, Gill entered the capsule and brought out all of the 65 men one by one by 8:30 am. Initially, it took 15 minutes for one round trip of the capsule. So, a 12-tonne crane was put into service for lowering and raising the capsule and this reduced the cycle time to just 3 minutes.",
      "There were 20,000 people who gathered to witness the rescue operation in Raniganj. “It took me six hours to bring up the 65 miners one by one and last of all, when I emerged from the capsule, people went mad with joy,” Gill once shared with The Tribune. He added that the moment he came out, people lifted him on his shoulders and put garlands around his neck.",
      "How was Jaswant Singh Gill rewarded for his act of bravery?",
      "To celebrate Gill’s act of bravery, Coal India Ltd announced November 16 as ‘Rescue Day’. Limca Book of Records has certified this operation as a national record in the history of coal mining.",
      "Gill was also honoured with the highest civilian bravery award, ‘Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak’ by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman in 1991.",
      "Until his death in 2019, Gill remained active in his social welfare work.",

      "Twelve papers published in reputable international journals by Rashmi Madhuri and Prashant Sharma from the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad have been retracted for image duplication. The first retraction was in February this year and seven more papers were retracted in March and April 2018. Four more papers were retracted on May 30. The retracted papers were published in two journals — Biosensors & Biomaterials and ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.",
      "Dr. Madhuri is Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Chemistry, while Dr. Sharma is Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Physics. Dr. Madhuri is the corresponding author of all the papers.",
      "Probe on",
      "“Investigation [into this issue] had already started before I came in as the Director in March end. Needless to say that we take such issues very seriously… the board will take a decision depending on the extent of guilt. The investigation will be completed shortly,” said Rajiv Shekhar, Director of IIT, Dhanbad.",
      "On PubPeer, a website that allows users to discuss and review scientific research that has been published, researchers had raised concerns about image duplication and manipulation in at least 38 research papers published by these researchers including the 12 papers that have been retracted. All the reused images were earlier published in their papers.",
      "‘Academic cybercrime’",
      "In an email sent to The Hindu in December last year, Dr. Madhuri had accused scientists posting on PubPeer of defaming her and called it academic cybercrime.",
      "“This is a new kind of “academic cybercrime/scam” in which some young researchers [of] Indian origin are targeted by small group of people as Indian scientists are soft targets,” she said.",
      "“It is worth mentioning that it is just a coincidence that most of the articles were published in last two-three years, whereas the work is the result of very hard work of our group [which has more than 10 PhD and postgraduate students] in the last six years,” she added.",
      "Dr. Madhuri did not respond to phone calls or reply to a mail sent to her.",

      "Investigation by a four-member committee formed by Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad to look at possible scientific misconduct by Rashmi Madhuri and Prashant Sharma has been completed. There has been a serious case of scientific dishonesty by the two faculty members. “The report prepared by the committee will soon be sent to the Board Chairman for further action,” says Professor Rajiv Shekhar, Director of IIT Dhanbad. He refused to divulge details of the report.",
      "Papers retracted",
      "Assistant Professors Madhuri (Department of Applied Chemistry) and Sharma (Department of Applied Physics) have 14 papers that have been retracted and two papers corrected for image duplication. All 14 papers were retracted this year. About 25 more papers with problematic images have been listed on Pubpeer, a website that allows researchers to discuss and review scientific papers that have been published. All the papers have issues with images that have been duplicated in same or subsequent papers to represent different materials or experiments.",
      "Talking to The Hindu on June 1, Professor Shekhar had said: “Investigation [into this issue] had already started before I came in as the Director in March-end. Needless to say, we take such issues very seriously … the Board will take a decision depending on the extent of guilt. The investigation will be completed shortly.”",
      "The fact-finding committee, comprising four members from other reputable institutions in India, had looked at all documents to bring out the facts and prepare a charge sheet against the two faculty members. “No one from the institute [IIT Dhanbad] is part of the committee,” Professor Shekhar said.",
      "Talking about procedures once the report is sent to the Board Chairman, he said the two faculty members will be served with a chargesheet once the Board approves the report. “If they accept the chargesheet then it goes to the Board for a decision on penalty,” he says. “If they don’t accept the chargesheet [contest the chargesheet] then another committee will look at their response [and take a decision].” “The next Board meeting will be held during September-end. The entire investigation will be completed by the end of this year. We wish to complete it as soon as possible,” Professor Shekhar said.",

      "The Supreme Court has assured help to a poor Dalit youth, who lost his hard-earned seat in IIT Dhanbad after he narrowly missed the deadline to deposit ₹17,500 as acceptance fee after clearing the prestigious exam in his last attempt.",
      "\"We will help you as far as possible. But what were you doing for the last three months as the fee deposit deadline expired on June 24,\" a bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra told the counsel for 18-year-old Atul Kumar on Tuesday (September 24, 2024).",
      "Mr. Kumar’s parents failed to deposit ₹17,500 as the acceptance fee by June 24, the deadline for depositing the requisite fees for blocking the seat.",
      "The parents of the youth also approached the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Jharkhand Legal Services Authority and the Madras High Court to save the hard-earned seat.",
      "His counsel told the bench that Mr. Kumar cleared the JEE Advanced in his second and last attempt and if the top court did not come to his rescue he would not be able to take another shot at the test.",
      "After very brief arguments, the bench issued notices to the Joint Seat Allocation Authority, IIT Admissions, IIT Madras, which conducted the test this year.",
      "The lawyer referred to the financial condition of the family of the youth.",
      "It was a very tough task for the students to arrange ₹17,500 by 5 p.m. of June 24, that too in just four days after allotment of the seat in IIT Dhanbad, the lawyer said.",
      "Mr. Kumar, son of a daily wager, hails from a Below Poverty Line (BPL) family living at Titora village in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh .",
      "The National Commission for Scheduled Castes also expressed its inability to help him.",
      "As he had taken JEE at a centre in Jharkhand, the youth had also moved to the Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority which suggested him to approach the Madras High Court as it was IIT Madras that had conducted the exam.",
      "The high court asked him to approach the top court.",

      "A federal court has issued a preliminary injunction protecting Priya Saxena, a 28-year-old Indian student and recent PhD graduate , from deportation after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attempted to revoke her valid F-1 student visa.",
      "Saxena, who recently received a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, faced unexpected visa revocation by the Trump administration in April.",
      "DHS cited a “criminal record” as the reason for cancellation, a claim her attorney strongly rejected. The only incident on her record was a minor 2021 traffic violation — failure to yield to an emergency vehicle, for which she paid a nominal fine.",
      "",
      "Despite the charge having no bearing under immigration law as a deportable offense, DHS moved to revoke her SEVIS status without prior notice or the opportunity for her to respond.",
      "",
      "Her attorney, Jim Leach, said Saxena had fully disclosed the infraction during her original visa application, and her F-1 visa, valid until 2027, had been issued after a thorough review. A suspected DUI from the same year was dismissed following a negative blood test.",
      "\"The government reissued her visa and then comes back three and a half years later and says, 'Oh, wait a minute. Get out of the country now,'\" Leach told NBC News. \"It just makes no sense.\"",
      "",
      "Saxena challenged the government's actions in court, arguing that DHS had violated the Administrative Procedure Act and her Fifth Amendment right to due process.",
      "Initially granted a temporary restraining order that allowed her to complete her studies and attend graduation, the court extended that protection Thursday with a preliminary injunction. This allows her to remain in the US and apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT), a program that permits international graduates to work in their field.",
      "Saxena, who holds both a PhD and a master's degree in chemical engineering from the same institution, recently received her doctorate in a graduation ceremony that drew attention for reasons beyond academics.",
      "While she was cheered by fellow students and faculty, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who received an honorary degree during the same event, faced vocal protests.",
      "Noem, who previously served as Secretary of Homeland Security under the Trump administration and has returned to the role under his revived leadership, is leading one of the nation’s most aggressive deportation campaigns.",
      "One protester outside the graduation ceremony held a sign that read: “A doctorate in graft I could understand,” while chants of “No honor for Noem” rang through the streets.",

      "Even to this day, communication from a disaster site or a mine field remains a problem despite advancements in technology as public mobile networks are weak in remote areas. To address this problem, a startup has come up with ‘Private 5G Box’, a tailor-made portable solution for enterprises seeking to deploy secure and private 5G networks.",
      "The start-up — Mantiswave Networks Private Limited — is funded by the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB) COMET Foundation.",
      "The customisable Private 5G Box works similar to a public mobile network and can be accessed by inserting private sim cards into mobile sets. When set up, Private 5G Box provides network coverage up to 500 meters. It also allows users to make cross network calls.",
      "“When a disaster strikes and network is completely down, this box can be taken to the disaster site to set up network and manage the disaster. Both voice and video calls can be made with this network,” said Prem Singh, Assistant Professor, IIITB. The box will have similar applications in mines where workers often have no facilities to make calls due to network issues.",
      "The start-up, which is co-founded by faculty members of IIITB, has developed base stations (network orchestrators) to facilitate this private communication. The compact, portable box integrates a 5G core and radio access network (RAN), which can provide instant 5G connectivity by using the base stations. It can support 5G usage in various forms, including video streaming, IoT applications, public safety, and smart industries.",
      "“Currently, only four companies in the world are making base stations. We have developed advanced 5G base stations from scratch. Our micro base stations (5G box) have small access points, like WiFi. They can be installed on any campus, industry, or mine, and used in healthcare and logistics sector too,” said Debabrata Das, Director, IIITB.",
      "The Private 5G Box costs around ₹10 lakh to be deployed in a small lab or office, and around ₹20 lakh for 500-meter coverage.",
      "Any organisation which purchases the Private 5G Box will have complete control over the data that passes through the network. They can decide where they would like to store the data.",
      "“The defense sector always needs a trusted network. If the base station is from another country, then we cannot be sure about its security. Since this network has been developed indigenously, it can also be used in the defence sector,” Prof. Das explained.",
      "The Private 5G Box has already been deployed at several customer sites, including Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dhanbad. It will soon be deployed in National Institute of Technology (NIT) Silchar and in SRM University in Chennai.",
      "“Recently, the defence sector took our Box for testing at one of their sites in Himachal Pradesh. We have also been invited by some mines for pilot deployment,” said Prof. Singh.",
      "The development of this product took around two years. The researchers continue their work on it to improve its performance and add more applications.",

      "Actor Akshay Kumar will next be seen in Mission Raniganj, where he plays the role of late coal mine engineer Jaswant Singh Gill. Remembering his meeting with Jaswant, Akshay described him as a “humble” and “simple” person.",
      "During a virtual interaction with students of the Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, Akshay spoke about the importance of telling stories of unsung heroes. He said, “A few years ago, I had the opportunity to talk on a call with Jaswantji when he was alive. He was so humble, simple, and down to earth that it was genuinely an honour talking to him. There’s so much truth and sacrifice in the inspiring stories of such unsung heroes that I would like to keep making films like that and tell today’s youth about such great visionaries.” Jaswant Singh Gill graduated from IIT Dhanbad.",
      "Akshay Kumar is known for doing films with a social message. Akshay has starred in Padman, based on social activist Arunachalam Muruganantham. He also did the film Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, which dealt with the health hazard of open defecation.",
      "Talking about being part of ‘inspirational stories’, Akshay said, “Jaswant Gill’s real-life story is truly inspiring and encouraging. Similarly, Padman also showcased the inspiring journey of a visionary. They don’t make people like them anymore. As an actor, I really love working on such inspirational stories that need to be told.”",
      "In 1989, Jaswant Singh Gill led a rescue mission that saved 64 people trapped in a coal mine in West Bengal’s Raniganj. Mission Raniganj also stars Parineeti Chopra in the lead role and is directed by Tinu Suresh Desai. The film will release in theatres on October 6.",

      "A native of Muzaffarnagar's Titora village, Atul Kumar studied for 18 hours a day, taking breaks only for food and sleep as he prepared for the much-dreaded IIT entrance exam.",
      "Despite the grueling schedule he sustained for 11 months, the 18-year-old, who almost didn't get into IIT despite cracking the test, advises against letting pressure get to your head.",
      "\"At my coaching institute, they said if you think the IIT entrance examination is tough, then it is indeed tough. If you consider it an easy exam, then it is an easy one,\" Kumar told PTI.",

      "\"We cannot allow such a talented young boy to go away. He cannot be left in the lurch,\" said a bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.",
      "Atul Kumar, who cleared the examination on his second attempt, told PTI that he took coaching for 11 months at a Kanpur institute designed for weaker sections.",

      "\"At the coaching institute, I studied for almost 18 hours a day. The only breaks from studying were to sleep and eat,\" he said.",
      "No stranger to hardships, the Dalit student also shared his thoughts on entrance exam aspirants who fall prey to peer pressure and choose to end their lives.",
      "\"One should not commit suicide. If one opportunity ends, then another opens up. If someone dreams of studying at IIT, they can pursue an MTech from IIT if they fail to get into BTech,\" Atul, who loves chemistry and looks to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as a role model, said.",
      "With the unexpected hitch behind him, both Atul and his entire village are now brimming with joy at his admission.",
      "Article 142 of the Constitution empowers the top court to pass any order in the interest of justice.",
      "Atul Kumar's prospect of getting into IIT was jeopardized when his parents failed to deposit Rs 17,500 as the acceptance fee by the June 24 deadline.",
      "\"I had almost made up my mind to sell my father's 1.5 bigha land. Thankfully, that situation did not arise. I would like to thank Justice Chandrachud ji and also thank my advocate,\" Atul's father, Rajendra Kumar, said.",

      "IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Dhanbad, IIT Dharwad, IIT Mandi, and IIT Bhubaneswar have discontinued this option, starting from this academic year",
      "To alleviate student stress, six Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have eliminated the branch-change option traditionally available at the end of the first year. This brings the total to nine IITs that have ended this practice.",
      "The branch-change option allowed IIT students to switch engineering streams after the first two semesters, provided they met the required Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) score. Each branch at every IIT had its own cut-off scores for accepting students from other streams.",
      "Starting this year, IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Dhanbad, IIT Dharwad, IIT Mandi, and IIT Bhubaneswar have discontinued this option. IIT Bombay, IIT Hyderabad, and IIT Jammu had already done so in 2023, 2021, and 2018, respectively.",
      "At IIT Madras, which holds the top spot among all IITs according to the National Institutional Ranking Framework, the decision to discontinue the branch-change option stemmed from a recent periodic review of the institute's curriculum. This review, conducted by a task force, is primarily aimed at enhancing and modernising the educational experience for students.",
      "Electives are courses that students can choose based on their personal interests or career aspirations. Unlike mandatory or core courses, electives provide the flexibility to explore different fields outside of their main area of study. By completing a set number of electives in a specific domain, a student can earn a minor degree in that field upon graduation.",
      "IITs are also promoting the option for students to pursue double majors within their BTech programs. This allows students to earn a second major alongside their primary one. However, it is important to note that a second major is not equivalent to a second degree, as the requirements for a major are significantly less demanding than those for a full second degree.",
      "In addition to free electives and double majors, IITs have recently introduced a third alternative: dual degree programs. IIT Madras, for example, offers a five-year program that combines a BTech and an MTech. Additionally, they offer interdisciplinary degrees in high-demand fields such as Nanotechnology, Data Science, and Electric Vehicles, among others.",

      "A poor Dalit youth from Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar moved the Supreme Court after he missed the chance to secure admission to IIT Dhanbad due to missing the deadline to deposit Rs 17,500 as an acceptance fee. The 18-year-old boy, identified as Atul Kumar, had cleared the prestigious exam in his last attempt but was unable to pay the required fee by the deadline of June 24.",
      "Atul was allotted a seat in Electronics Engineering at IIT Dhanbad. According to Atul, his family, struggling with financial constraints, had managed to gather the necessary funds by borrowing from neighbours.",
      "However, while Atul was able to upload the required documents on the online portal of IIT Dhanbad, the website logged him out automatically at 4:56 pm, just minutes before the 5 pm deadline, preventing him from completing the fee payment.",
      "",
      "Following this incident, Atul sought legal recourse. Initially, he approached the Jharkhand High Court, which advised him to file a petition in the Madras High Court. However, after a hearing in the Madras High Court, his lawyer suggested withdrawing the case due to delays caused by the respondent.",
      "",
      "Consequently, Atul knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court.",
      "During a hearing on September 24, a Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra assured all possible help to the Dalit youth.",
      "",
      "\"We will help you as far as possible. But what were you doing for the last three months as the fee deposit deadline expired on June 24,\" the top court said.",
      "The next hearing on the matter is scheduled for Monday, September 30.",
      "Atul’s father, Rajendra, works as a labourer in a factory, and the family’s financial situation has been a significant challenge. Atul is the youngest of four brothers, all of whom have excelled academically despite the family's hardships.",
      "After completing his high school education in Khatauli and his intermediate education at Shishu Shiksha Niketan, Atul prepared for IIT entrance exams at Gehlot Super 100 Institute in Kanpur, securing a place at IIT Dhanbad.",
      "Atul’s mother, Rajesh Devi, shared the family's struggles, stating that they had taken loans from multiple sources to finance their children's education. Despite the challenges, all four brothers are dedicated to their studies, with two of them pursuing engineering degrees, one from NIT Hamirpur and the other from IIT Kharagpur.",
      "Neighbour Praveen Kumar also praised Atul and his brothers for their dedication to their studies, emphasizing that the entire village is aware of their hard work and the financial difficulties the family faces. \"The only reason Atul couldn't secure his admission was because they couldn't pay the fee on time,\" he added.",
      "Even Atul's former teacher, Rajkumar, from GR Public School in Titoda, recalled his academic brilliance. \"Atul was one of the most intelligent students. It's unfortunate that he is facing this situation due to technicalities. His family is extremely poor, and they don't even have an inverter at home. Despite all odds, Atul and his brothers have worked hard and made it to prestigious institutions like IIT and NIT,\" said the teacher.",

      "\"All The Best\": Supreme Court To Dalit Student After Ordering IIT Admission",
      "Dalit Student Admission In IIT Dhanbad: For three months the father of the student did the rounds of the SC/ST Commission, then the Jharkhand and Madras High Court. In the end, he approached the Supreme Court.",
      "Related News",

    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "Rs 17,500. That's the fee that a Dalit student had to pay to secure his admission into the prestigious IIT Dhanbad. Atul Kumar, from Uttar Pradesh, had four days to submit the fee. The student's father, a daily wage labourer, tried all he could, but missed the fee deadline by a whisker. Not giving up, he then took the fight to courts.",
      "For three months, the father did the rounds of the SC/ST Commission, the Jharkhand and Madras High Courts. In the end, when nothing worked, he approached the Supreme Court.",
      "\"We cannot allow such a young talented boy to go away. He cannot be left in lurch. He went to Jharkhand Legal Services Authority. Then to Chennai Legal Services Authority and then he is sent to High Court. He is a Dalit boy being made to run from pillar to post,\" said Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, ordering the IIT to admit the student.",
      "\"We are of the view that a talented student like the petitioner who belongs to a marginalised group who did all to secure admission should not be left out... we direct that candidate is granted admission to IIT Dhanbad and let him be in the same batch to which he would have been granted admission if the fee would have been paid,\" the bench said in its order.",
      "The petitioner's counsel said the student's father earns Rs 450 daily. \"The task of arranging 17,500 is a big deal. He collected money from villagers.\"",
      "\"The only thing that stopped him from paying was the inability to pay and as the Supreme Court of India, we need to see that,\" the Chief Justice said.",
      "The top court used its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution in asking the IIT Dhanbad to admit Atul Kumar into its Electrical Engineering BTech course. Article 142 of the Constitution empowers the top court to pass any order in the interest of justice.",
      "",
      "",
      "\"All the best. Achha kariye (Do well),\" the Chief Justice told the 18-year-old student, who comes from a village in Muzaffarnagar district of UP.",
      "A relieved Atul Kumar said the \" derailed train is back on track now \".",
      "\"I have been provided with the seat. I am very happy. The court said my seat could not be snatched away solely due to a financial problem. The train that had derailed is back on track now,\" he said with a smile. Atul said he was hopeful of getting help from the top court.",
      "Asked what lies ahead, he replied, \"I will work hard and become an electrical engineer from IIT-Dhanbad.\"",
      "What The Family Went Through",
      "The parents of Atul Kumar failed to deposit Rs 17,500 as the acceptance fee by 5 pm on June 24, the deadline for depositing the fee for blocking the seat.",
      "The student's father managed to crowdsource the amount by 4:45 pm on the last day. As Atul began uploading his documents, the time for submission of fee was up. A dream crushed, the family regrouped and took the legal route.",
      "As the student wrote the exam at a centre in Jharkhand, he first approached the Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority which suggested him to approach the Madras High Court as it was IIT Madras that had conducted the exam.",
      "The high court, in turn, asked him to approach the top court.",

      "Land Rising In Delhi's Dwarka, Points To Groundwater Bouncing Back: ISRO-IIT study",
      "The study said groundwater levels across Delhi rose by more than 1.5 metres between 2018 and 2021, even though rainfall dipped during the same period.",
      "Related News",
      "Trending News"
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "For years, the ground beneath southwest Delhi quietly sank as its aquifers ran dry. Now, satellites show a rare reversal; the land in Dwarka is rising again, a sign that the city's long-depleted groundwater is slowly bouncing back, a study claimed.",
      "The research paper, titled 'InSAR Reveals Recovery of Stressed Aquifer Systems in Parts of Delhi, India', published in the Water Resources Research journal, examined satellite data from October 2014 to October 2023.",
      "Land subsidence, or ground sinking, has stopped and reversed in parts of the national capital, it said.",
      "The paper, authored by scientists from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), IIT Kanpur, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, and the University of Miami, reported that land in Dwarka, one of Delhi's most groundwater-stressed zones, began to rise around mid-2016.",
      "\"The land there has since uplifted by 5 to 10 centimetres, climbing at a rate of up to 2 cm per year across nearly 4 square kilometres, that is about 988 acres of land,\" it claimed.",
      "Researchers said the shift indicates that the underground aquifer is refilling and expanding as water pressure rebuilds.",
      "“The analysis suggests a gain in groundwater storage (0.002-0.007 cubic kilometres per year) and the onset of pore pressure saturation due to groundwater level recovery in the Dwarka area,” the study said.",
      "",
      "",
      "This gain, observed between 2016 and 2023, equals roughly 2-7 billion litres of water every year -- enough to refill hundreds of Olympic-sized swimming pools or meet the yearly water needs of an entire Delhi neighbourhood.",
      "Several groundwater monitoring wells in and around Dwarka, including those in Vikas Puri, Janakpuri, and Dabri West, showed evident water-level rises of a few centimetres each year, it said.",
      "In contrast, water levels of wells in Chhawla village, Kakrola, and Sagarpur either remained stable or continued to decline slightly.",
      "The researchers said the areas showing uplift align closely with the wells where water levels improved.",
      "The study said groundwater levels across Delhi rose by more than 1.5 metres between 2018 and 2021, even though rainfall dipped during the same period.",
      "“The sustained rise in groundwater level during 2018-2021, despite decreasing rainfall, provides strong evidence for substantial recovery of groundwater resources through improved management,” the paper noted.",
      "The turnaround follows Delhi's 2016 groundwater policy, which limited new borewells, made rainwater harvesting mandatory, and required all large housing projects to include recharge structures.",
      "These measures, the study said, appear to have stabilised the city's overdrawn aquifers.",
      "According to the paper, subtle changes were visible elsewhere. A mild uplift of about 1 cm was detected west of the Yamuna River, suggesting stabilisation in those zones, while parts along the eastern edge of Delhi continued to sink by 2 to 3 cm, equivalent to a slow annual dip of about 1 to 1.5 per cent in ground elevation.",
      "Outside Delhi's boundary, the trend remains mixed. In Gurugram, which has faced some of the worst ground sinking in the region, the land subsided by more than 1 metre between 2014 and 2023, it said.",
      "But the pace has slowed significantly. Between 2014 and 2018, central Gurugram saw a subsidence of about 15 cm per year, and for the southern part of the city, it was 6 cm per year. After 2018, they have come down to around 10 cm and 2 cm per year, respectively.",
      "“The decay of subsidence in the central and southern parts of the Gurgaon area points to the beginning of pore pressure equilibration, which results from reduced extraction and enhanced recharge,” the authors said.",
      "The researchers explained that the slowing of ground-sinking in Gurugram means the underground water system there is beginning to balance itself after years of overuse.",
      "As less water is being pumped out and more rainwater and recharge water are filtering back into the soil, the pressure inside the aquifer layers is evening out.",
      "This balance, called pore pressure equilibration, helps reduce the compaction of soil underground, which, in turn, slows down how quickly the land is sinking, they explained.",
      "However, conditions in Faridabad remain worrying. The study found that the land there is still sinking faster, with the subsidence rate doubling, rising from about 2 cm per year before 2017 to nearly 4 to 5 cm per year since then.",
      "Researchers said the acceleration is likely due to continued over-extraction of groundwater for domestic and industrial use.",
      "The authors concluded that while Delhi's aquifers are showing early signs of recovery, areas around Gururgram and Faridabad continue to lose water.",
      "They said sustained satellite monitoring could help pinpoint recharge-deficient zones and guide future conservation efforts.",

      "How Supreme Court cleared 10 Bills using extraordinary powers",
      "The Supreme Court on Tuesday used its extraordinary powers to clear 10 Bills. It criticised Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi's \"pocket veto\" of the Bills, and resorted to Article 142, which was rarely used before, for \"complete justice\". The use of Article 142 had earlier been criticised as \"judicial overreach\".",
      "WHAT IS ARTICLE 142 THAT SC USED IN TAMIL NADU CASE",
      "IMPACT OF SUPREME COURT'S USE OF ARTICLE 142 IN TAMIL NADU CASE"
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "The Supreme Court on Tuesday criticised Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi for sitting over 10 Bills passed by the legislative Assembly, and took the rare step of clearing the Bills . The court used its extraordinary powers under Article 142, which allows it to deliver \"complete justice\".",
      "Article 142 of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court extraordinary powers. It was a rarely used legal provision earlier, but has come to be used more regularly in the last few years.",
      "The use of Article 142 had come under criticism earlier over \"judicial overreach\".",
      "",
      "On Tuesday, the two-judge bench of Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan held the withholding of the bills as \"illegal\" and \"liable to be set aside\". The bench criticised the \"pocket veto\" used by Governor Ravi to delay the Bills.",
      "",
      "Clearing of Bills is primarily the function of the legislature and the executive organs of the government.",
      "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin hailed the SC decision as a \"historic victory\" , while DMK cadres welcomed the judgment by bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets.",
      "",
      "The judges called the governor’s action a \"roadblock\", and by the powers vested in them by Article 142, they declared the 10 Bills as having received assent because of the \"unduly long period of time for which these bills were kept pending by the Governor before the ultimate declaration of withholding of assent and in view of the scant respect shown by the governor\" to the apex court’s previous decisions on similar matters.",
      "Justifying this as not being a case of judicial overreach, the bench stated that the governor \"must act with due deference to the settled conventions of parliamentary democracy, respecting the will of the people being expressed through the legislature as well as the elected government responsible to the people\".",
      "",
      "The otherwise rarely used Article 142 was used thrice in 2024.",
      "Most recently, this provision was used in October 2024 by the apex court by intervening to admit a Dalit youth in IIT Dhanbad after he missed the fee deadline.",
      "Earlier in April 2024, the SC used the provision to grant a divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act in a case where a marriage had irretrievably broken down even when one party opposed the divorce. In February, the SC used Article 142 to overturn the results of the mayoral election in Chandigarh where there was evidence of tampering with the fair electoral process.",
      "The SC's use of Article 142 in the Chandigarh mayoral polls case was criticised by some as judicial overreach, who questioned the judiciary's role in electoral processes.",
      "Article 142 of the Constitution states: The Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, and any decree so passed or order so made shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in such manner as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such manner as the President may by order prescribe.",
      "",
      "Tuesday's decision by the Supreme Court was hailed as a victory for the democratic and federal system of the country by Kerala’s Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who had earlier locked horns with former governor of Kerala, Arif Mohammed Khan, over a similar issue.",
      "\"A big and historic win for Tamil Nadu and its elected government,\" tweeted Sasikanth Senthil, a Congress MP from Tamil Nadu.",
      "\"The Supreme Court, invoking Article 142, has rightly ordered assent to all 10 Bills stalled by the Governor, a clear message that Governors are not above democracy,\" he added.",
      "Through its judgment, the Supreme Court also declared that the Governor does not have the authority to sit indefinitely on Bills and must act within the framework laid out in Article 200 of the Constitution. The SC ruling will also redefine Centre-state equations .",
      "It set a timeline for the reservation of Bills for the consideration of the President by the Governor as limited to a month except when it is withheld in contrary to the advice of the state council of ministers, the limit for which is three months.",
      "The Supreme Court's judgment is a landmark decision that curbs ‘pocket veto’ and sets a timeline for governors to act on Bills cleared by legislative Assemblies. It is also a rare instance when the court cleared 10 Bills using its extraordinary powers under Article 142.",

      "The Supreme Court on Monday directed IIT Dhanbad to grant admission to a Dalit student who lost his seat after missing the deadline to deposit the fee.",
      "During a hearing on Monday, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said, \"We cannot allow such a young talented boy to go away. He went to Jharkhand legal services authority. Then he went to Chennai legal services and then he was sent to high court. A Dalit boy is being made to run from pillar to post.\"",
      "Atul Kumar, 18, cleared the prestigious JEE exam in his last attempt and was allotted a seat in Electronics Engineering at IIT Dhanbad. However, he was unable to pay the required fee by the deadline of June 24.",
      "",
      "Kumar, a resident of Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar and the son of a daily wager, approached the Jharkhand High Court and Madras High Court before moving the Supreme Court.",
      "",
      "The student's lawyer told the Supreme Court that his father earns Rs 450 per day. \"The task of arranging Rs 17,500 is a big deal. He (father) collected the money from villagers,\" he said.",
      "The advocate appearing for IIT Dhanbad said that the National Informatics Centre (NIC) sent Atul Kumar a SMS and IIT sent him two WhatsApp chats to finish payment.",
      "",
      "\"He made login every day,\" the IIT's advocate said.",
      "To this, Justice Pardiwala said, \"Why are you opposing so much? Why are you not finding the way out? The seat allotment intimation slip shows that you wanted him to pay and if he did, then nothing else was required.\"",
      "Chief Justice Chandrachud said, \"He is such a bright student. The only thing that stopped him was Rs 17,000.\"",
      "\"No child should be left like this just because he doesn't have fees of Rs 17,000,\" he added.",
      "The Supreme Court noted that the deadline to deposit the fee was 5 pm on June 24. The student's parents arranged for the fee by 4.45 pm but when they made the payment, it was not processed and the portal closed at 5 pm.",
      "\"The login details indicate that he was diligent to log into the portal. There was no considerable reason why the petitioner would have done so if he didn't have the fees to pay. We are of the view that a talented student should not be left in the lurch. We direct that admission be granted to IIT Dhanbad,\" the court said in its order.",
      "The Chief Justice said that Atul Kumar should be admitted to the same batch and a supernumerary seat be created for him without disturbing the candidature of any other student.",
      "\"All the best. Acha kariye (do well),\" the Chief Justice wished Atul Kumar.",

      "Belonging to a small village, Pakri Barawan in Nawada district, 100 km south of Patna, Niranjan is not ashamed of his humble background.",
      "“I used to sit at my father’s small shop and sell khaini when he would go out. My father still runs the shop, even as I tell him he doesn’t need to anymore for a monthly earning of Rs 5,000,” says Niranjan.",

      "“Coming from a poor background, my father did not have enough money for the education of his children – three sons and a daughter. I successfully took the written test for admission to the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Nawada, for the simple reason that education was free there,” he recollects.",

      "“Even to pay the tuition fee of Rs 1,200 for two years was not easy for me. I used to walk 8-10 kms every day for my coaching classes. Later, after one-and-a-half years, I bought a second hand bicycle with Rs 600, which I saved by imparting tuitions to children, while staying with my uncle in Patna to pursue my intermediate studies,” he recalls.",
      "Niranjan went on to compete in IIT-ISM, Dhanbad for mining engineering course. He took an education loan of Rs 4 lakh from bank that he repaid after joining the Coal India Limited as an assistant engineer (mining) in 2011.",

Six of them — Utsav Kaushal (14th rank) Somesh Kumar Upadhyay (34th), Prema Dikshit (57th), Soumya Jha (58th), Aarif Ehsaan (74th) and Shashi Prakash Singh (75th rank) are in top 100 in the list of 1099 successful candidates pan India.",

      "Almost two-thirds of MTech seats remain vacant across India, while BTech enrolment has seen a decade-long recovery.",
      "CAREER IN MTECH: A MORE MEANINGFUL PROBLEM",
      "THE ROLE OF DROPOUTS AND FEES FOR ALLOCATED SEATS"
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "Unfilled BTech and MTech courses are rampant in some of the esteemed public institutions, which experts attribute to an inability to keep up with less sought-after course intake. Issues like these are highly concerning for the IITs and NITs institutes.",
      "Under RTI, The Telegraph has obtained certain information about the number of vacant seats this year for the 13 IITs and 276 BTech, and 1165 seats in MTech and MSc programmes went unfilled.",
      "This has led to an increased degree of unfilled seats in the NITs too, including 401 unfilled seats in BTech and 2604 degrees in MTech & MSc spread across the 19 NITs.",
      "",
      "Different IITs have diverse rates of vacancy. For example, in IIT Dhanbad, which has 1,125 BTech seats, they reported 72 unfilled seats for 2024. In the 234 unfilled postgraduate programmes, the year for 2023-2024 and the year for 2022-23 had 67 and 53 vacancies respectively.",
      "",
      "In BTech this year, IIT Guwahati has also seen an increase in vacant seats with a total of 37. Other IITs have not yet presented or disclosed their vacancy numbers.",
      "",
      "The MTech level positions are especially alarming, even in the older and elite IITs. For example, IIT Bombay had 332 PGT seats vacant in 2022-23, 345 in 2023-23, and 257 in 2024-25. IIT Delhi, which is also a top institute, has reported 416 seats vacant in 2024-25 while the previous two years had 438 and then 376.",
      "",
      "Both IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi have close to 800 MTech seats available each.",
      "",
      "Student withdrawal during the MTech programmes is another reason for unfilled seats. The absence of centralised Mtech programme counselling allows students to select courses that suit them, but this can result in higher dropout figures.",
      "IITs, like their NIT equivalents, impose a seat allocation fee (SAF) before counselling to discourage frivolous admissions. This practice is mired in controversy, however, because it has led to instances such as a legal battle centred around a Dalit student at IIT Dhanbad, who could not settle with the SAF on time.",
      "There have been calls to abolish the fee entirely on the assumption that it creates unnecessary obstacles for students hoping to secure seats in the institution. On the other hand, it is claimed by the government that this fee ensures the reduction of dropouts and better management of vacant seats.",
      "Nonetheless, it is suggested that the data around vacancies suggests the fee is not serving its intended purpose.",
      "A more streamlined admissions process would surely address the sheer volume of vacant seats while still enabling students to reap the benefits of attending a well revered institution.",

      "The Supreme Court directed IIT Dhanbad to admit Atul Kumar, with the Uttar Pradesh government covering his fees through a scholarship",
      "Following an incident in which a Dalit student from Uttar Pradesh, Atul Kumar, nearly lost his seat at IIT Dhanbad due to delayed fee payment, the state government is taking steps to prevent similar issues in the future. Plans are underway to register all IITs, IIMs, and other prestigious institutions with the Department of Social Welfare to ensure seamless scholarship distribution to eligible students.",
      "The move comes after the Supreme Court directed IIT Dhanbad to admit Kumar, an 18-year-old from Muzaffarnagar, who lost his seat in the Electrical Engineering branch after missing the admission fee deadline by just a few minutes. The Uttar Pradesh government announced it would cover Kumar's entire fee through a scholarship.",
      "Social Welfare Minister Asim Arun revealed that the state aims to help all students in similar situations. Arun explained that they plan to contact national institutes outside Uttar Pradesh for registration with the Department of Social Welfare to facilitate the timely disbursement of scholarships. IIT Dhanbad is expected to be the first institute to complete registration, ensuring smooth scholarship transfers for Kumar and other eligible students.",

      "Many IITs and IIMs outside Uttar Pradesh are not yet registered with the state's scholarship system, but steps are being taken to change this. Arun noted that currently, three government departments — Social Welfare, Backward Welfare, and Minorities Welfare — manage scholarship disbursement, with the Department of Social Welfare acting as the central body.",
      "Additionally, Kumar will receive a \"free-ship card,\" which allows eligible students to enrol in institutions and secure fee waivers, part of the state's new zero-balance admission policy. Arun has also personally assured Kumar's family of financial support for his education.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "By: Editorial",
      "For equality of opportunity to be meaningful, a person from a marginalised caste and a poor family must be able to move beyond his or her circumstances, and rise. Atul Kumar did just that, in no small part due to the arduous sacrifices of his family. The Dalit aspirant cleared the entrance exam for IIT-Dhanbad. But it took the Supreme Court of India’s intervention to ensure he could get a seat in the prestigious college. His father, a daily wage labourer from Titora village in western Uttar Pradesh, who had studied till class 9, had to move the apex court after Atul was denied admission because he was a few minutes late in depositing the Rs 17,500 fee on the university’s online portal.",
      "While instructing IIT-Dhanbad to provide Atul a seat, the Chief Justice of India said, “… as judges of the SC, we should ensure that no child loses admission because they don’t have Rs 17,500.” The bench is right, of course. But the Court’s comment raises a more fundamental question about the hurdles of bureaucracy in an unequal society. Rules and regulations are essential in an education system where demand far outstrips supply. However, they inevitably become, for many, another hurdle in a system that is already difficult to navigate. There are many like Atul, who overcome huge odds to make it to India’s premier educational institutions. And to be fair, many universities, including the IITs, have put in place systems to assist them in their time at the university. Atul Kumar’s case highlights the need to make compassion a part not just of the teaching process and campus life — it must begin at the beginning, with the admissions system.",
      "Were it not for the intervention by the Court, Atul Kumar’s story could have been a tragedy. A superficial and simplistic idea of “merit” permeates many spaces. Atul’s father told this newspaper how he sold property, how he stretches Rs 11,000/month to make sure his children have the best education. To start so far behind many others and make it as far as Atul has, shows a depth of “merit” that must be encouraged and nurtured. There are many Atuls in this country. It is for governments — from the states to the Centre — to ensure that India does not become a country of high inequality and low mobility, where aspiration is, more often than not, a statistical fairytale."

      "The family members of Atul Kumar, who lost his hard-earned IIT Dhanbad seat after missing the deadline to deposit admission fees by a few minutes, at Titora village in U.P.’s Muzaffarnagar, Monday, September 30, 2024.\n                                          | Photo Credit: PTI",
      "In one of the hundreds of modest un-plastered, bare-bricked homes in Muzaffarnagar’s Titora village, Tuesday morning was busy. The entire household was packing. In a matter of days, 18-year-old Atul Kumar, the youngest child of the household, will move to a hostel of the Indian Institute of Technology in Dhanbad.",
      "The previous day, the Supreme Court had intervened and passed a direction to protect Atul’s seat at the premier engineering institute , paving the way for the confirmation of his admission. Three months ago, the JEE (Advanced) 2024 exam results had come, and Atul had secured a rank of 1455 in his category. Even though his family had arranged the ₹17,500 required to complete the process, the institute’s portal had closed by then.",
      "“We were celebrating throughout on the way back home. I must thank the media, the court and the Chief Justice for bringing us justice,” said Atul’s father Rajendra, a Dalit daily-wage labourer who also works as a part-time tailor. “I am elated. Still as excited as I was yesterday when the Supreme Court’s decision came. I can’t wait to get to the campus,” Atul told The Hindu over the phone on Tuesday.",
      "Both he and his father had come to New Delhi to hear the court deliver its judgement on Monday.",
      "As the family got packing the following day, Atul said he was thinking about what to take and what to leave behind. His mother, Rajesh, said, “I have been thinking about what to send along with him. All I can think of is the food I know he likes.”",
      "Rajendra was busy fielding calls from press persons and thanking well-wishers, many of whom were offering to pay for Atul’s tuition at IIT Dhanbad.",
      "But amidst the happiness in the Kumar household about having “won a battle” with IIT’s “unfair” system, as Atul described it, his father was nervous about sending his boy out into the world of elite institutes, where complaints of abuse, and implicit and explicit ways of discrimination and social isolation are regular.",
      "Rajendra, 46, grew up among the few hundred families of the Chamar community in Titora village, which is otherwise dominated by the Gurjar community. “I realise that things have changed since I was young but even now, I see in the media what happens to some students in big institutes,” he said.",
      "Father to four sons, Rajendra has had the conversation about discrimination with his children as each of them left home to study, his eldest son getting the talk at 10 when he went to study at a Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya. “Don’t act on impulse and always come to me if there is ever even a hint of discrimination. Beyond this, the values are simple. I am teaching them to be good human beings,” he said.",
      "“Once the formalities are over. I will be going to IIT Dhanbad with him, settling him in, meeting with some of his friends and maybe seniors and faculty too. This is most important,” Rajendra said. No matter the circumstances, he said he must “go to the ground” and check on his children wherever they are.",
      "His eldest son is studying B.Tech at National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, the second son is at IIT, Kharagpur, studying Chemical Engineering and the third son is a Hindi undergraduate student at the Sri Kund Kund Inter College in Khatauli, closer to home.",
      "Atul, however, appears to be less worried and more focused on the course. “I am certain I will be able to study better at the hostel. Six other students I knew from the coaching centre have also secured seats there. I have been pining for this life ever since my brother inspired me,” he said.",
      "Atul has kept his dream of going to the IIT alive while studying in between daily power cuts and doing household chores like collecting grass for the cattle. For the last leg of the preparation, he was at a free coaching centre in Kanpur, courtesy of the CSR initiative of a PSU. “I want to focus on exploring the first year of engineering so I can zero in on my interest area,” he said.",
      "But the road to IIT Dhanbad was cleared only through directions of the Supreme Court, where Atul and his family reached after having gone through the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, the Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority and the Madras High Court over a period of three months after reaching a dead end trying to communicate their grievance to the institute. “Of course, it is an unfair system. If it was any humane institute, it would have asked me for an explanation as to why I am unable to submit the fees and hear the explanation. The whole thing would have been resolved,” Atul said.",
      "Now, amid a flood of offers to pay for Atul’s education, Rajendra said he would prefer not to take any money if he can afford it. “I have always made tough decisions for the education of my children. We have about 1 to 1.5 bigha land that my forefathers had left me. That is on hold if any need arises at all,” he says. “So, I thank everyone who is offering but I would prefer exploring options of an education loan first.”",
      "Rajendra had decided early on that he would find a way to educate his sons well, preferably in a private school, an option that was not available to him when he was growing up in the same village.",
      "“Whatever I have read of Ambedkar has driven the importance of education into me and I found that with my sons I did not have to push much. Educating them well was the way to ensure their overall development at every level and so we put everything into it and I will continue to do so,” he said.",

      "Why India-UK deal on critical minerals points to New Delhi’s anxiety over Chinese grip",

    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "The fine print of the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) has a signal towards India’s growing anxiety over the Chinese chokehold on the critical minerals’ supply chain, and how New Delhi is aiming to counter Beijing’s dominance in the sector.",
      "This follows a similar initiative by the Quad (comprising India, Australia, Japan, and the United States) earlier this month, where they launched an initiative to secure supply chains of critical minerals, as worries grow around China’s stranglehold over the resources, which are vital to new technologies.",
      "The India-UK Vision 2035, a document outlining the broader collaborative goals of the free trade agreement between the two said that they will work together to develop cutting-edge technology and research, building on the Technology Security Initiative, focused on future telecoms, artificial intelligence and critical minerals, laying the ground for future collaboration on semiconductors, quantum, bio-technology and advanced materials.",
      "To further cooperation in critical minerals, the two countries will also establish a UK-India Critical Minerals Guild to “transform financing standards and innovation”, according to a joint statement by the two.",
      "“Together, the two sides will prioritise processing (of critical minerals), R&D, recycling, managing risk to supply chains, market development etc. and will champion circular economy principles and advance traceability,” it said.",
      "As part of the deal with the UK, the second phase of the UK-India Critical Minerals Supply Chain Observatory (SCO) will receive £1.8 million in new funding to set up a satellite campus at the Indian School of Mines in Dhanbad. The funding will also support developing the world’s largest digital data infrastructure on the critical minerals value chain, according to an official joint statement.",
      "The SCO is housed within the Industrial Resilience Research Group at the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing. The first phase, which involved sharing, monitoring, and analysing supply chain data on critical minerals like lithium, copper, nickel, and cobalt, was launched in collaboration with IIT Bombay in October last year.",
      "Critical minerals, which include rare earth elements (REEs), are an important component of various cutting-edge hardware, ranging from semiconductors and electric vehicles to jet fighters.",
      "Rare earth magnets, especially neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, are crucial for EV manufacturing, particularly in electric motors. They provide the strong magnetic fields needed for efficient and powerful electric motors, including traction motors that drive EVs. These magnets also play a major role in other EV components such as power steering systems, wiper motors, and braking systems. China has a near monopoly over the production of these rare earth magnets.",
      "Following US President Donal Trump’s tariff onslaught on other countries in April, China implemented specifically designed bureaucratic hurdles for foreign companies looking to source critical minerals from the country.",
      "While the availability of rare earth metals is not limited to China, it is in the efficient processing of these critical elements where Beijing has a substantial lead, which was once enjoyed by the US and Japan.",
      "In recent years, Japan has been able to restart some of its minerals processing industry owing to government policies, but countries like the US and India are heavily dependent on Chinese exports of these metals.",
      "In response to the US administration’s reciprocal tariff heat, China restricted exports of seven heavy rare earth metals including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium, as well as rare earth magnets. Earlier, it had also banned exports to the US of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications.",
      "India’s nascent but slowly growing EV industry has faced a direct impact of Chinese restrictions on export of rare earth magnets. None of the applications made by Indian carmakers to source the critical minerals have yet been accepted by Beijing, with automakers staring at shortages and potential setbacks to production plans.",
      "China requires companies to secure an end-user licence, along with an endorsement from the local government that the minerals will not be used for military applications. However, the fact that China has not yet cleared any application from Indian entities is a cause of concern.",
      "Worrying still is a fresh insistence from Beijing that instead of sourcing magnets separately, carmakers buy entire electric motor assemblies from Chinese companies, or simply wait for the Chinese authorities to issue export permits to local rare earth magnet producers, as has been done, according to Reuters, for at least four magnet producers that include suppliers to Volkswagen — the first granted since Beijing restricted shipments earlier this year. The German carmaker is said to have lobbied hard with Beijing to get this done.",

      "Female coders have to work twice as hard to be at par with men: She Codes 2019 winner",
      "Low visibility of female coders and lesser exposure to girls regarding programming, which is considered a male bastion, make them work twice as hard as men to come at the same level, says Indeed She Codes 2019 winner Anjali Rani Pahal, an IIT-Dhanbad student."
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "Since women achievers in science are hardly ever heard of, it’s twice as difficult for others who opt for it, believes Anjali Rani Pahal, the winner of She Codes — a nationwide code programming competition for women organised by Indeed, a recruitment platform.",
      "A third-year student of mechanical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Dhanbad, Anjali taught herself coding through online platforms. “I chose mechanical engineering to gain working knowledge of the physical components, which would help me design better software. I learnt coding through online courses and followed up with courses in machine learning and deep learning during the summer break of my first year,” said Anjali, who has participated in several coding competitions, including HackeEarth.",
      "She is, however, of the view that there is a gender divide in the programming industry. “In my experience, boys tend to get involved in coding at a much younger age than girls, which tends to give them an edge over women coders. I only learnt about coding when I started college, but people start coding as early as class 11,” she said.",
      "Video | IIT teacher: Why do parents need to know the scope of a course?",
      "“Due to limited exposure, women coders sometimes end up working twice as hard to be on the same level as male programmers. If there was more visibility for women in the field, it would inspire others to come forward and explore their interests,” Anjali adds.",
      "She remarks that being from a non-computer background was in fact an advantage for her as she could bring ‘a new perspective’ to things, which helped her have an edge in the competitions.",
      "Daughter of military personnel, Anjali hopes to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science, followed by a career in the automation space.",

The Model Code of Conduct does not need statutory recognition. However, the commission opposes a constructive no-confidence vote and codifying the poll code."

      "Atul Kumar’s story is one of sheer determination. Hailing from Titora village in Muzaffarnagar, the 18-year-old faced a crushing blow when he missed the fee payment deadline for IIT Dhanbad, despite successfully clearing the JEE Advanced Exam.",
      "The Rs 17,500 acceptance fee was due on June 24, 2024, but his family, supported by his father’s modest daily wage, couldn't gather the funds in time.",
      "Atul’s dream of becoming an engineer was suddenly hanging by a thread. But then came a lifeline – one that would change everything.",
      "",
      "The Supreme Court of India stepped in to give Atul Kumar a second chance. Under Article 142 of the Constitution, which allows the court to pass any order in the interest of justice, a bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud ordered IIT Dhanbad to admit Atul to its BTech programme.",
      "",
      "\"We cannot allow such a talented young boy to go away. He cannot be left in the lurch,\" the bench declared. It was a moment of immense relief not just for Atul, but also for his family and the entire village.",
      "",
      "Atul’s journey to cracking one of the toughest entrance exams in India was nothing short of extraordinary.",
      "",
      "He studied for 18 hours a day , with breaks only for food and sleep, for 11 months at a Kanpur-based coaching centre that caters to economically weaker sections.",
      "His dedication finally paid off when he cleared the exam on his second attempt.",
      "But his success didn’t come without its challenges. Coming from a Dalit family and facing immense financial pressure, Atul’s story is a reminder of the hurdles many students face in pursuing higher education.",
      "Atul, who is passionate about chemistry and looks up to Dr BR Ambedkar as a role model, had a message for other aspirants feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of entrance exams.",
      "“If one opportunity ends, then another opens up. If someone dreams of studying at IIT, they can pursue an MTech from IIT if they fail to get into BTech,\" he said.",
      "With his court battle behind him, Atul is now looking ahead to his studies at IIT Dhanbad, where he plans to pursue a career in engineering, following in the footsteps of his older brother, who is studying at IIT Kharagpur.",

      "Twenty seven students across 10 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in the country have committed suicide in the last five years, reply to a Right to Information (RTI) query has revealed.",
      "As per the data provided by the Department of Higher Education working under the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), IIT-Madras tops the list with suicides by seven students during this period.",
      "In the reply to a query asked by RTI activist Chandrashekhar Gaur on December 2, the MHRD said that between 2014 and 2019, seven students from IIT Madras, five from IIT-Kharagpur and three each from IIT-Delhi and IIT-Hyderabad committed suicide.",
      "Two students each from IIT-Bombay, IIT-Guwahati and IIT-Roorkee also ended their lives during the period, it said.",
      "During this period, one student each from Varanasi's IIT (BHU), IIT (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad and IIT Kanpur took the extreme step.",
      "",
      "",
      "However, no reply was given to the query which sought to know the reasons behind the IIT students' suicides.",
      "When asked about the measures taken to prevent student suicides in the country's premier technical institutes, the reply said, \"Systems are in place in IITs to enquire and take action in all complaints received from students in IIT campuses, which includes Student Grievance Cell, Disciplinary Action Committee, Counseling Centres, etc.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Anand Kumar, founder of \"Super 30\", a Patna-based institute giving coaching to meritorious students from poor families to prepare for the IIT entrance examination, expressed concern over the suicides by the students belonging to the top technical institutes.",
      "Talking to PTI, Mr Kumar said, \"In the present situation, the nature of selection process for the IITs needs to be changed. In this process, students with innovative skills who are able to withstand different pressures of life should be given preference.\"",
      "He said that the number of teachers in IITs should be in proportion to the students, so that each one gets proper attention.",
      "He also suggested that special English classes should be started for the students who reach IITs after studying in non-English medium schools to aid them in their studies.",
      "Currently there are 23 IITs across the country.",
      "According to the information received from the RTI, no suicide case was reported during past five years at the IITs in Indore, Patna, Jodhpur, Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Ropar, Mandi, Tirupati, Palakkad, Bhilai, Jammu, Goa and Dharwad.",

      "Mumbai: The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dhanbad has joined hands with the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Mumbai to offer a five-year integrated dual-degree program. Bachelor of Technology (B Tech) degree and Master of Business Administration (MBA) will be combined to equip students with technical expertise as well as managerial acumen to meet modern industry needs.",
      "The newly introduced program is designed to provide students with a seamless education experience across engineering and management domains.",
      "Professor Manoj Kumar Tiwari, IIM Mumbai director, said, “The curriculum includes foundational and advanced engineering courses during the initial years at IIT Dhanbad, followed by in-depth management studies during the final 1.5 years at IIM Mumbai. Upon successful completion, students will earn a BTech degree, in their chosen discipline, from IIT Dhanbad, along with an MBA degree from IIM Mumbai.”",
      "He added that as the 2025-26 academic year begins, the program will be open to first-year B Tech students during their pre-registration for the third semester (Monsoon Semester).",
      "A circular issued by IIT Dhanbad announced that applications for this integrated program will soon be invited from existing B Tech students who are entering their fourth or sixth semester for the Winter Semester (WS) 2024-25, ensuring that students from diverse academic stages can explore this path.",
      "Students enrolled in the program will benefit from the combined resources, faculty expertise, and industry connections of both institutions. This dual-degree program is expected to enhance graduates’ employability, making them highly sought after by multinational corporations, startups, and government organizations. He also said that IIT Patna had signed a MoU with IIM Mumbai earlier for the dual degree, and other IITs are also enquiring about the same.",

      "At the 2025 Mining Conclave, CM Vishnu Dev Sai unveils key MoUs, launches upgraded digital portals, and calls for sustainable, innovation-led development in the mineral-rich state."
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai on Sunday said that scientific mining practices and digital governance are “writing a new story of growth and transparency” in the state, as he inaugurated the Chhattisgarh Mining Conclave 2025 in Nava Raipur.",
      "The event, held after a gap of nine years, saw a series of major agreements and policy launches aimed at modernising the state’s mineral sector. These included a memorandum of understanding between the Indian School of Mines (ISM) Dhanbad and the Directorate of Geology & Mining, Chhattisgarh, and another between Coal India and the Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation (CMDC).",
      "Sai also launched Khanij Online 2.0, DMF Portal 2.0, and a Reverse Auction Portal for sand mine e-auctions which are digital platforms meant to enhance transparency and ease of doing business in the sector.",
      "Record Revenue, New Policy Push",
      "Highlighting the state’s mining potential, Sai said Chhattisgarh earned a record Rs 14,195 crore in revenue from the sector in FY 2024-25 and received Rs 1,673 crore under the District Mineral Foundation (DMF), funding over 9,300 development projects.",
      "Sai noted that Chhattisgarh is the first state in India to auction a lithium block, underscoring its role in India’s push for critical minerals vital to the clean energy transition. So far, 60 mineral blocks have been auctioned, and tenders for five new blocks were issued today, Sai added.",
      "The Chief Minister also announced the implementation of District Mineral Trust Rules-2025 under the Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY), saying the upgraded DMF Portal has strengthened accountability in the use of funds for mining-affected areas.",
      "Technology and Sustainability",
      "Sai said the new Sand Policy-2025 will further transparency, with over 200 sand quarries set to be e-auctioned soon. The state has partnered with MSTC, a Government of India PSU, to operationalise a Reverse Auction Portal for fair and efficient sand mine allotments.",
      "Sustainable Mining",
      "The Chief Minister also presented the Star Awards to 43 mines for excellence in environmental management and safety standards. Of these, three received 5-Star, 32 earned 4-Star, and eight bagged 3-Star ratings. The awards mark Chhattisgarh’s efforts to promote scientific mining even among minor mineral operations.",
      "With 28 minerals currently being mined, including tin, bauxite, coal, limestone, and iron ore, Chhattisgarh is positioning itself as a national model for innovation-driven and environmentally responsible mining.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "The Law Commission has determined that the simultaneous elections Bills are constitutional and do not need state ratification. They do not impact voting rights or government accountability. The Model Code of Conduct does not need statutory recognition. However, the commission opposes a constructive no-confidence vote and codifying the poll code."

      "The first level of investigation by a four-member committee formed by Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad to look at possible scientific misconduct by Dr. Rashmi Madhuri and Prashant Sharma has been completed. “The report prepared by the committee will soon be sent to the Board Chairman for further action,” says Prof. Rajiv Shekhar, Director of IIT Dhanbad. He refused to divulge any details of the report.",
      "Assistant Professor Dr. Madhuri (Department of Applied Chemistry) and Assistant Professor Dr. Sharma (Department of Applied Physics) have 14 papers that have been retracted and two papers corrected for image duplication. The first retraction was in February this year and seven more papers were retracted in March and April 2018. Four more papers were retracted on May 30 this year. About 25 more papers with problematic images have been listed on Pubpeer website, a website that allows users researchers to discuss and review scientific papers that have been published. All the papers have issues with images that have been duplicated in same or subsequent papers to represent different materials or experiments.",
      "Talking to The Hindu on June 1, Prof. Shekhar had said: “Investigation [into this issue] had already started before I came in as the Director in March end. Needless to say that we take such issues very seriously… the board will take a decision depending on the extent of guilt. The investigation will be completed shortly.”",
      "The fact-finding committee, comprising of four members from other reputable institutions in India, had looked at all documents to bring out the facts and prepare a charge sheet against the two faculty members. “No one from the institute [IIT Dhanbad] is part of the committee,” Prof. Shekhar says.",
      "Prof. Shekhar says the scientific misconduct appears serious.",
      "Talking about what entails once the report is sent to the Board Chairman, he says the two faculty members will be served with a charge sheet once the Board approves it. “If they accept the charge sheet then it goes to the Board for a decision on penalty,” he says. “If they don’t accept the charge sheet [contest the charge sheet] then another committee will look at their response [and take a decision].”",
      "“The next Board meeting will be held during September end. The entire investigation will be completed by the end of this year. We wish to complete it as soon as possible,” Prof. Shekhar says.",

      "Uttar Pradesh government has decided to register all IITs, IIMs and other premier institutes with its Department of Social Welfare to provide scholarships to students. The decision to register the premier institutes has come after a Dalit student from Uttar Pradesh almost lost his IIT seat due to delayed fee payment. IIT Dhanbad is the first institute to be registered with the department. The institute was on Monday directed by the Supreme Court to admit the son of a daily wager from Muzaffarnagar's Titora village who was deprived of his seat due to non-payment of fees. Atul Kumar (18) is a student of Electrical Engineering branch at IIT Dhanbad. He missed the deadline to pay the admission fee of Rs 17,500 by a few minutes. On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh government had announced that it would bear Kumar's entire fee through scholarship. The state government now plans to help all such students. \"We will write to all such institutes of national importance, including IITs and IIMs, that are located outside the state for registration to enable seamless scholarship disbursement to all eligible candidates from the state who get admitted in these institutes,\" Social Welfare Minister Asim Arun told PTI. Currently, three Uttar Pradesh government departments -- Social Welfare, Backward Welfare and Minorities Welfare -- disburse scholarships. The Department of Social Welfare is the nodal department for all scholarships and framing rules for it.",

      "Priya Saxena, an Indian PhD student at a university in South Dakota, whom the Trump administration has been attempting to deport from the United States, has won a legal reprieve from a federal court, allowing her to stay in America. The 28-year-old  who recently received a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology faced deportation after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unexpectedly revoked her F-1 student visa in April over a minor traffic violation.",
      "After Saxena's visa was terminated -- which was valid till February 2027 -- her Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) record was deleted, which could have potentially prevented her from completing her studies and graduating on May 10. But, Saxena sued the Trump administration in mid-April and was granted a temporary restraining order by a federal judge. This allowed her to complete her doctorate and graduate over the past weekend.",
      "According to court documents, the Trump administration revoked Saxena's student visa due to a \"criminal record\" against her. But her only infraction was from a minor traffic violation in  2021 when she failed \"to stop for an emergency vehicle\", for which she paid a fine.",
      "Her attorney told The Guardian that under immigration law, minor infractions like Saxena's are not deportable offences.",
      "This week, a federal court in South Dakota issued a preliminary injunction blocking the DHS from arresting and detaining her without court approval, allowing her to stay in the country. The judge said DHS's actions \"appear unlawful and are likely to cause Saxena irreparable harm\", The Guardian report said.",
      "",
      "",
      "Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has launched a crackdown on immigration that has also targeted international students across the US. Visas and SEVIS of thousands of international students were removed over minor infractions, traffic violations or pro-Palestinian activism on campus. Most of the students targeted by DHS were in the US legally.",
      "During a recent hearing, DHS told a court that it scanned the names of over 1 million international students through an FBI database to look for criminal records. The search yielded 6,400 matches, following which approximately 3,000 visas were revoked.",

      "Engineers' Day: The first IIT was established at Kharagpur in 1951 and the latest IIT was established in Goa in 2016. There are a total of 23 IITs across the country.",
      "Pre-existing Institutes that were converted into IITs",
      "IIT Roorkee (established in 1847, became an IIT in 2001)",
      "IIT Varanasi (established in 1919, became an IIT in 2012)"
    ],
    "paragraphs": [
      "Engineers’ Day 2023: The concept of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) was first introduced in the year 1945 in a report by NM Sircar, then a member of Education on Viceroy’s Executive Council.",
      "In 1946, a committee was set by Sir Jogendra Singh, member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, Department of Education, Health and Agriculture to consider setting up of Higher Technical Institutions for post war Industrial Development in India. The committee, headed by NR Sarkar, recommended the establishment of four higher technical institutions in eastern, western, northern and southern regions, possibly on the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA. The report also urged the government to establish the institutions in East and West, to be started immediately.",
      "The committee believed that the aim of these institutes should not be limited to producing engineering graduates, and IITs should also focus on research, producing research workers and technical teachers. The committee wanted to match the international standards in research. They aimed to have the proportion of undergraduates and postgraduate students as 2:1.",
      "The institute was given the title of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) on September 21, 2001 but the history of the college is nearly 175 years old.",
      "IIT Roorkee originally began as a training school at Saharanpur in 1845 and was called Thomason College of Engineering from 1847 to 1947. On September 21, 1853, the college was renamed Thomason College of Civil Engineering. The entrance test for college began in 1857. In 1864, the Roorkee College was affiliated to Calcutta University. In 1905, the affiliation to Allahabad University ended.",
      "In 1948, Roorkee University Act was passed by the provincial legislature and in 1949, Thomason College was elevated to university status.",
      "IIT BHU was established in 1919. The institutes started with the establishment of Banaras Engineering College (BENCO), and the next stage saw the establishment of the College of Technology (TECHNO) and the College of Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET). With time, it merged to form the Institute of Technology (IT-BHU).",
      "On June 29, 2012, the institute became IIT (BHU) Varanasi by an Act of Parliament. The over 100-year-old institute was established by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya.",
      "In December 1901, a resolution by the Indian National Congress at its XVII session stated that: “In view of the fact that the tendency of recent legislation namely, The Indian Mines Act VII of 1901, is that all Indian mines must be kept under the supervision of mining experts.”",
      "The Indian School of Mines and Applied Geology at Dhanbad was established by the then Viceroy Lord Irwin on December 9, 1926. In 1996-97, the Indian government took over the control of the institute. On September 6, 2016, the Indian School of Mines (ISM) became the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad.",
      "In 1956, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany offered assistance to establish a higher technological institute in India. It resulted in the signing of the first Indo-German Agreement in Bonn in 1959 to establish IIT Madras. The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by professor Humayun Kabir, then Union Minister for Scientific and Cultural Affairs.",
      "IIT Delhi was established as College of Engineering in 1961 and later declared as an Institution of National Importance under the ‘Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 1963’ and renamed as IIT Delhi. IIT Delhi is a collaboration with the Government of the UK. The then Indian government negotiated with the British government to set up IIT Delhi.",
      "Established in 1958, it was the second IIT in the country. It was the first to be set up with foreign assistance receiving funds from UNESCO, it came as Roubles from the then Soviet Union. In 1961, the Parliament decreed the IITs as ‘Institutes of National Importance’.",
      "The Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur was established by the government in 1959. It began its operations in a borrowed building of Harcourt Butler Technological Institute with 100 students. Today, the institute has its own residential campus for about 2255 undergraduate and 1476 postgraduate students, 309 faculty members and over 900 supporting staff members.",
      "The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur was the first IIT to be established in the country. It was established in May 1950 in Hijli, Kharagpur. In the first batch (August 1951), there were 224 freshers and 42 teachers.",
      "The institute was given the title of Indian Institute of Technology on September 21, 2001. In December 2001, Dr Prem Vrat took charge as the director of IIT Roorkee. In October 2022, Professor Kamal Kishore Pant took charge as director.",
      "Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati is the sixth member of the IIT fraternity. It was established in 1994 and the academic programme commenced in 1995.",
      "Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) was established in 2008. It offers undergraduate programmes in engineering disciplines, applied sciences, and design as well several interdisciplinary areas. There are separate programmes for technology, design, science and liberal arts.",
      "IIT Gandhinagar was founded in 2008 and is located in Palaj, Gandhinagar (Gujarat) on the banks of River Sabarmati. It is India’s first five-star GRIHA LD (Green) campus for minimising the negative impact on the environment.",
      "IIT Indore was established in 2009. The institute started functioning from a temporary campus at the Institute of Engineering and Technology of Devi Ahilya University under the mentorship of IIT Bombay in 2009–10.",
      "The Indian School of Mines and Applied Geology at Dhanbad was established by the hands of the then Viceroy Lord Irwin on December 9, 1926.",

      "The Law Commission has determined that the simultaneous elections Bills are constitutional and do not need state ratification. They do not impact voting rights or government accountability. The Model Code of Conduct does not need statutory recognition. However, the commission opposes a constructive no-confidence vote and codifying the poll code."

      "Ranchi: At least 15 Jharkhand youngsters have cracked the Union Public Service Examination (UPSC), India’s central agency authorized to conduct the civil services examinations, this year. Of them, seven are women.",
      "Six of the successful candidates are from the twin cities of Dhanbad-Bokaro. Few of them have been ex-students of the reputed Indian School of Mines (ISM), Dhanbad that recently got IIT status.",
      "“We are glad to learn that some of our ex-students have cracked India’s most coveted exams to become civil servants,” ISM Dhanbad registrar Col M K Singh, said, adding, “It’s a proud moment for all of us at our institute and Dhanbad town.”",
      "While Nitish Kumar of Palamu, who stayed in Ranchi and Delhi most of the time to prepare for the civil services, secured the highest 23 rd rank, Jyoti—she goes by one name-- of Jamshedpur had to settle with rank 872, the lowest among the 15 UPSC achievers from the state.",
      "Prerna Dixit, currently posted as divisional forest officer (DFO), Ramgarh is the second candidate while P Anvwesh Reddy from Dhanbad is the third one from the state in the below 100 rank. While Dixit secured 57 th rank, Reddy cleared the exam securing 80th rank among the 1099 candidates from across the country who cleared the prestigious exam.",
      "Prerna had cracked UPSC last year but got selected for the forest service. She became DFO of Ramgarh in February but decided to take another attempt at the civil service examinations as she wished to become an IAS officer.",
      "Having secured the 57 rank automatically qualifies her for the administrative service and become an IAS officer. Elated on having fulfilled her wish, she told reporters, who called her after the results were declared, that as a DFO she took several initiatives towards conservation of forests but many things were in the pipeline and she didn’t get much time.",
      "“I hope I would get Jharkhand cadre so that I come back as a deputy commissioner of Ramgarh and carry out several development work that I couldn’t initiate as a DFO,” she said.",
      "ISM authorities said Reddy was a 2010 batch pass-out but the family seems to have migrated to another city as she never came to the institute thereafter. HT could not trace the family in Dhanbad.",
      "Ranchi Burdhman Compound resident, Basukinath Jha has secured 378 rank that qualifies him for a job in the Indian Revenue Service (IRS), but this young mechanical engineer from CV Raman College, Bhubaneshwar isn’t satisfied with his performance. He wants to become an IAS officer and hence has decided to take another shot at the civil services exams.",
      "Jha said, after completing engineering, he had worked for two years at TVS Motors before he decided to quit the job and went to Delhi to prepare for UPSC. The mechanical engineer missed his first attempt at the examination as he failed to clear the interview. This was his second attempt at the exam.",
